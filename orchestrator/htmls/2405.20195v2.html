<h6 class="ltx_title ltx_title_abstract">Abstract</h6>
<p class="ltx_p" id="id1.id1">Humanitarian negotiations in conflict zones, called <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="id1.id1.1">frontline negotiation</em>, are often highly adversarial, complex, and high-risk. Several best-practices have emerged over the years that help negotiators extract insights from large datasets to navigate nuanced and rapidly evolving scenarios.
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked interest in the potential for AI to aid decision making in frontline negotiation. Through in-depth interviews with 13 experienced frontline negotiators, we identified their needs for AI-assisted case analysis and creativity support, as well as concerns surrounding confidentiality and model bias. We further explored the potential for AI augmentation of three standard tools used in frontline negotiation planning. We evaluated the quality and stability of our ChatGPT-based negotiation tools in the context of two real cases. Our findings highlight the potential for LLMs to enhance humanitarian negotiations and underscore the need for careful ethical and practical considerations.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p1.1">Humanitarian negotiations in conflict zones, known as <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p1.1.1">frontline negotiation</em>, help secure access to crisis-affected populations for aid delivery <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Global Interagency Security Forum (2020), <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20195v2#bib.bib10" title="">GISF</a>)</cite>. These negotiations are often highly adversarial, complex, and high-risk. Stakeholders are fragmented geographically, politically, and culturally. Negotiators must <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p1.1.2">quickly</em> navigate conflicting perspectives by synthesizing unstructured information, including interviews, stakeholder meetings, and historical documents. Given the time pressure on negotiators, efficient and accurate information synthesis is crucial <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(e.g. Subramanian, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20195v2#bib.bib17" title="">2023</a>; Bruderlein, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20195v2#bib.bib5" title="">2023</a>)</cite>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p2.1">To address this challenge, negotiators developed templates to assist in manual information processing. Three templates we studied are: the Island of Agreement (IoA), Iceberg and Common Shared Space (CSS), and Stakeholder Mapping (ShM) <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Centre of Competence on Humanitarian Negotiation &amp; Bruderlein, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20195v2#bib.bib6" title="">2019</a>)</cite>. Using these templates, negotiators can efficiently organize unstructured data into clear positions and stakeholder intentions.
Nonetheless, manual processing is time consuming and can introduce errors (which are costly in real-life terms). Here, large language models (LLMs) might be leveraged to assist in information extraction and synthesis for frontline negotiation.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p3.1">However, LLMs pose risks such as “hallucinations” <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(e.g. McKenna et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20195v2#bib.bib13" title="">2023</a>)</cite> and susceptibility to privacy attacks <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(e.g. Neel &amp; Chang, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20195v2#bib.bib15" title="">2023</a>)</cite>. Thus, it is unclear if their benefits outweigh the risks for frontline negotiations. This work addresses the following research questions: (1) Can LLMs generate reliable and useful frontline negotiation case summaries? (2) What are additional use cases for LLMs in this domain? (3) What are the specific ethical and practical concerns associated with using LLMs in frontline negotiation? (4) What are the barriers to the adoption of LLM-powered tools by frontline negotiators?</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p4.1">We first explored summarization using OpenAI’s GPT-4 API on two real, anonymized frontline negotiation cases to fill out the IoA and ShM templates. We found that GPT-4 showed strong consistency in its responses, producing highly similar summaries (measured by cosine similarity) across 30 API calls for both IoA and Iceberg/CSS. Additionally, GPT-4 generated IoA and Iceberg/CSS results comparable to those manually populated by negotiators. While negotiators typically spend hours or days on these templates, ChatGPT completes them in seconds.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p5">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p5.1">We next conducted interviews with 13 experienced frontline negotiators. Using a video of GPT-4 filling out Iceberg templates with one of the anonymous cases as a design probe <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Gaver et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20195v2#bib.bib9" title="">1999</a>)</cite>, we stimulated discussion with negotiators. We identified two key uses for LLMs in frontline negotiation: (1) <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p5.1.1">Context Analysis</em>: Automating parts of context analysis for long documents and unstructured texts. (2) <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p5.1.2">Ideation Augmentation</em>: Proposing alternative plans, arguments, or solutions.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p6">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p6.1">Negotiators also highlighted several concerns about integrating LLMs into their workflow: (1) <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p6.1.1">Confidentiality:</em> Proprietary model providers may not ensure data confidentiality. (2) <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p6.1.2">Western bias in LLMs:</em> Bias embeddd within LLMs may influence the conclusions drawn by negotiators. (3) <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p6.1.3">Adoption barriers:</em> Public, donor and mandator <span class="ltx_note ltx_role_footnote" id="footnote1"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_note_outer"><span class="ltx_note_content"><sup class="ltx_note_mark">1</sup><span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_note">1</span>Donors provide financial and material support, while mandators grant the authority and framework for negotiators to represent their interests <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Centre of Competence on Humanitarian Negotiation &amp; Bruderlein, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20195v2#bib.bib6" title="">2019</a>)</cite>.</span></span></span> opinion on AI may affect adoption of LLM tools. (4) <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p6.1.4">Accuracy and trust:</em> LLMs are prone to hallucinating and generating ungrounded content. (4) <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p6.1.5">Incompleteness:</em> LLM-based automation may fail to capture the emotional and human-centric aspects of frontline negotiation. (5) <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic" id="S1.p6.1.6">Overreliance:</em> Overreliance may cause users to overlook mistakes made by LLMs.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S1.p7">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S1.p7.1">Overall, our results demonstrate the potential for LLMs to assist frontline negotiators. In particular, we explored auto-filling negotiation templates and generated reliable summaries that are comparable to those written by experts. While many negotiators have already begun using tools like ChatGPT in their daily work, our research is the first to formally study the benefits and risks associated with using LLMs for frontline negotiation. Given the sensitive and high-stakes nature of humanitarian negotiations, we recommend further investigation into the risks we identify to ensure safe and ethical adoption of LLMs in this domain.</p>

We used an iterative prompt-engineering approach to develop three pipeline tools, starting with system prompts outlining the LLM’s role and expectations. This involved defining task objectives, creating instructions, and specifying output formats, followed by refinement based on feedback from negotiators. The full process is detailed in Appendix <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20195v2#A1.SS1" title="A.1 Synthesizing Tool Development ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ Using Large Language Models for Humanitarian Frontline Negotiation: Opportunities and Considerations"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">A.1</span></a></p>

We evaluated the tools based on three principles: stability of responses, benchmarking against negotiator responses, and response time. First, we measured consistency using cosine similarity to ensure low variance and minimal hallucinations. For IoA and Iceberg/CSS, we used <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter" id="S3.SS1.p2.1.2">sklearn.metrics</span>. For ShM, we used <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter" id="S3.SS1.p2.1.3">sklearn.spatial</span> to measure the cosine spatial distance between the stakeholder map graph centroids. Second, we benchmarked against human negotiators by calculating semantic similarity between the LLM and human responses for Iceberg/CSS and IoA.

To compare these with the LLM-generated responses, we processed all texts using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to capture the general semantics more effectively <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Devlin et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20195v2#bib.bib8" title="">2018</a>)</cite>.

Our quantitative evaluation of ChatGPT’s capabilities in humanitarian negotiations compared AI-generated responses with those from experienced practitioners to assess consistency and reliability. The results showed that LLMs can reliably generate stable, uniform outputs and templates comparable in accuracy to human negotiators. While human negotiators took a week or more to complete templates, ChatGPT did so in seconds. These findings support <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S6.p1.1.2">H1</span> and <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S6.p1.1.3">H2</span>, demonstrating that LLMs can effectively support frontline negotiators by providing consistent templates, thereby enhancing preparation and execution of negotiations.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.p2.1"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S6.p2.1.1">Needs for LLMs in Frontline Negotiation: </span>
Our qualitative interviews revealed that some negotiators have already started using LLMs for frontline negotiations, primarily for context analysis and argument ideation. These findings support <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S6.p2.1.2">H3</span>, suggesting that frontline negotiators are likely to accept and integrate LLM tools into their workflows if these tools address their key concerns. However, negotiators also emphasized the need for better support in prompt-engineering and a deeper understanding of LLM limitations. Future studies should focus on these areas, and training programs within humanitarian organizations should be designed to help negotiators better understand and effectively use these tools.</p>
</div>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.p3.1"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S6.p3.1.1">Concerns over LLMs in Negotiation: </span>
Privacy and confidentiality are paramount concerns for humanitarian negotiators. Therefore, any LLM system introduced must guarantee stringent privacy standards and clearly disclose its terms. Leakage of confidential information could endanger negotiators and other involved parties, leading to distrust and disruptions.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S6.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.p4.1">Biases are present in every negotiation domain undermining outcomes. LLMs could further skew viewpoints if they provide, for example, Western biased summaries to negotiators operating in other geographies. These findings support <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S6.p4.1.1">H4</span> and reveal a strong need to align LLMs to address these practical and ethical concerns. Since negotiators have already begun integrating LLMs into their workflows, it is crucial to build their capacity to mitigate or identify LLM biases. Consequently, there is a pressing need for comprehensive educational programs and enhanced interface support across organizations to address these limitations.</p>

Privacy and confidentiality concerns can be partially addressed through the right infrastructure investments. For example, many open-source LLMs <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(BigScience, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20195v2#bib.bib3" title="">2022</a>; Zhang et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20195v2#bib.bib20" title="">2022</a>; Black et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20195v2#bib.bib4" title="">2022</a>; Institute, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20195v2#bib.bib12" title="">2023</a>)</cite> and models optimized for local deployment <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Abdin et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20195v2#bib.bib1" title="">2024</a>; Google AI, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20195v2#bib.bib11" title="">2023</a>; Mistral AI, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20195v2#bib.bib14" title="">2023</a>; Salesforce AI, <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20195v2#bib.bib16" title="">2023</a>)</cite> can generate text comparable to, or even better than, ChatGPT in some domains. By properly observing data and privacy practices, we can ensure the confidentiality required by negotiators. Future work in this area might include comparing the performance of open-source models with our GPT-based negotiation tools.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.p6.1"><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold" id="S6.p6.1.1">Address Trust, Overreliance and Overautomation before Adaptation: </span> Concerns about adapting LLMs in negotiation come not only from negotiators themselves but also involved communities, donors, and negotiation mandators. These concerns often stem from broader issues inherent in LLMs that remain unaddressed. We have identified risks related to trust, over-reliance, and over-automation. To successfully integrate LLM tools into negotiation processes, technologists need to demonstrate a thorough understanding of these key issues (e.g., do negotiators trust LLMs even when LLMs make mistakes?) and address them through improved algorithms and interface design.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S6.p7">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.p7.1">Technologists must carefully consider where automation is appropriate. Studies have indicated that careless automation only increases manual labor <cite class="ltx_cite ltx_citemacro_citep">(Beede et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20195v2#bib.bib2" title="">2020</a>; Ulloa et al., <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20195v2#bib.bib19" title="">2022</a>)</cite>. For example, negotiators noted that their standard practices do not align with the input formats suited for LLMs. This misalignment affects the adoption of LLM tools and necessitates changes in existing data management practices, such as capturing notes or case data more systematically and continuously. Negotiators might perceive these changes as burdensome. To address this issue, further design work is needed to support negotiators beyond summarization, including aiding in data collection and providing other workflow support.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_subsection">6.1 </span>Conclusion</h3>
<div class="ltx_para" id="S6.SS1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="S6.SS1.p1.1">Our research is the first to demonstrate the potential for LLMs to assist frontline negotiators by auto-filling negotiation templates and providing consistent, reliable summaries that are comparable in quality to those written by human experts. Interviews with negotiators indicated key uses for LLMs in context analysis and ideation augmentation, but also highlighted concerns surrounding confidentiality, embedded biases, barriers to adoption, accuracy, and overreliance. While many negotiators already use tools like ChatGPT, our study formally assesses the benefits and risks, emphasizing the need for further investigation to ensure safe and ethical adoption. Ultimately, we hope that LLMs can enhance the efficiency, safety and effectiveness of humanitarian negotiations, aiding the delivery of critical aid to crisis-affected populations.</p>

Facts include number and features of the beneficiary population, location of this population, technical terms of the assistance programs (time, date, mode of operation), nutritional and health status of the population, etc. Norms include right of access to the beneficiary population, obligations of the parties, legal status of the population, and priority of the operation, etc.
Step 2 - Recognizing which areas of the conversation are most/least promising in the establishment of a relationship and which concrete issues will need to be negotiated with the counterparts.
Step 3 - Elaborating a common understanding with the counterpart on the point of departure of the discussion while underlining the specific objectives of the negotiation process.
For each category, please provide a structured list of items. Follow this structured response format:
- Contested Facts: Fact1, Fact2, …
- Agreed Facts: Fact1, Fact2, …
- Convergent Norms: Norm1, Norm2, …

The X-axis represents stakeholders’ inclination towards change, from transformative (left) to conservative (right). The Y-axis is customizable based on the negotiation’s context, ranging from local (bottom, negative) to global (top, positive) influence. The counterparty, identified as the party with interests most opposing those of the protagonists, is always placed at the origin (0,0) and at the center of the graph, marked in red. The axes are displayed with scales, ranging from -10 to +10, and are colored black. Ensure that labels for each stakeholder are appropriately positioned next to their corresponding dots on the map for clarity. Plot the protagonist with a green dot. Ensure that you also label the counterparty red dot with the name of that stakeholder, with the label appropriately positioned next to the point.

<div class="ltx_para" id="A1.SS9.SSS1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="A1.SS9.SSS1.p1.1">Due to the rapidly changing scenarios and conditions faced during frontline negotiations, negotiators often deal with long documents, unstructured texts, and the need to update their preparation in light of new information. Some negotiators have already begun using ChatGPT for context analysis. One participant mentioned that many steps during context analysis could potentially be automated by AI:</p>

During this process, negotiators suggest that LLMs can propose alternative plans for them to consider, thereby widening their options. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="A1.SS9.SSS2.p1.1.2">“It’s not an official opinion, but I just don’t want to let my brain be single minded.

<div class="ltx_para" id="A1.SS9.SSS3.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="A1.SS9.SSS3.p1.1">Knowledge sharing between negotiators involves new negotiator training and sharing experiences of past cases. Sharing past cases is an important part of the negotiation process. Despite efforts, challenges remain in utilizing case studies due to the need for anonymization and the requirement for similar contextual relevance. For instance, a negotiator recounted how their colleague shared supposedly “similar” cases with differing contexts, which ultimately led to unsuccessful negotiations. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="A1.SS9.SSS3.p1.1.1">“[My colleagues] give us previous experiences where people have negotiated in similar situations.

<p class="ltx_p" id="A1.SS9.SSS3.p2.1">Another negotiator shared the same concern over the limitations of knowledge sharing, citing the loss of institutional memory as a major challenge. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="A1.SS9.SSS3.p2.1.1">“I think one of the challenges we have in our organization. I think it’s happening in most of the organizations is institutional memory. We that the more like we lose all this incredible knowledge about how negotiations went 20 years ago, when we face the same people with the same challenges.”</span> They emphasized the importance of capturing the strategies and common ground found in past negotiations, rather than just the outcomes. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="A1.SS9.SSS3.p2.1.2">But what I care about is the strategy. What was the common ground that was found in that moment? So having a dataset that can propose not only from your organization, your own institutional memory, but probably like from others that could be probably an interesting thing.”</span> They suggested that a dataset of decontextualized cases could be a valuable resource, but noted that confidentiality agreements often prevent organizations from learning from each other’s experiences. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="A1.SS9.SSS3.p2.1.3">“But at the same time [confidentiality] prevents all the community to learn from one another, and to maybe expect those lessons. Maybe AI can be trusted enough that these cases can be decontextualized.”</span> (P10)</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="A1.SS9.SSS3.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="A1.SS9.SSS3.p3.1">Sharing past experiences while maintaining confidentiality could not only inspire new negotiation strategies but also help anticipate an opponent’s future moves based on their past decisions. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="A1.SS9.SSS3.p3.1.1">“Having a lot of information on past decisions they’ve made or having an insight into their foreign policy is quite important.

<div class="ltx_para" id="A1.SS10.SSS1.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="A1.SS10.SSS1.p1.1">The information that the negotiators have to handle often require meticulous consideration over confidentiality. For example, during negotiation training, real cases for education purposes are anonymized. Negotiators proposed that common confidentiality practices should be applied to usage of LLMs too. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="A1.SS10.SSS1.p1.1.1">“[Confidentiality] is a very big concern. And that is why when we are doing training of our staffs, we can just say, country A, country B, or country C. There’s a way you can quote these cases, and not really making it clear that, for example, ‘okay, this is from Congo. This is from Cameroon’. We can replicate the practice here working with the AI things, because when it comes to data, it is very sensitive in these conflict areas. We need to really protect those who are coming out to share those information. It’s very important.”</span> (P5)</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="A1.SS10.SSS1.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="A1.SS10.SSS1.p2.1">Moreover, negotiators felt that they were not equipped with adequate understanding of LLM, particularly concerning privacy and the appropriate usage of sensitive information.
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="A1.SS10.SSS1.p2.1.1">“I found it interesting that my organization has already put in place some kind of restrictions on the way we should, or we can use AI but we are still in the beginning of steps of understanding the the capabilities and also the the potential consequences, and so on. The guidance we have received is still very vague and very broad. there will be more guidance, and restrictions when we want to use ChatGPT or other similar tools.”</span> (P8)</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="A1.SS10.SSS1.p3">
<p class="ltx_p" id="A1.SS10.SSS1.p3.1">These concerns support Hypothesis 4, highlighting the significant ethical and practical issues that arise with the deployment of LLMs in humanitarian negotiations, especially data confidentiality. The need for clear guidance and understanding underscores the importance of addressing these issues to ensure the ethical application of LLMs.</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="A1.SS10.SSS1.p4">
<p class="ltx_p" id="A1.SS10.SSS1.p4.1">Although there’s hesitation over confidentiality, negotiators who have been using ChatGPT in their workflow gradually felt more comfortable after using the tool for a while.
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="A1.SS10.SSS1.p4.1.1">“[Confidentiality] is actually what I was very worried about at the start. When I started, I was dealing with high security things in [country A], and I was like would not put any security things in there. Will there be information breaches? But with ease of use, and seeing how useful it was, I then started to feel much more comfortable. I still don’t put high security things or security protocols or confidential documents into it. But I feel much more at ease, say, to put transcripts in and, like, ask for summaries of this, where I think at the beginning I would not have. I would not do that if it was a high stakes discussion that I didn’t want anyone to know about.”</span> (P4)</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="A1.SS10.SSS1.p5">
<p class="ltx_p" id="A1.SS10.SSS1.p5.1">This gradual increase in comfort suggests that, as negotiators become more familiar with LLMs and their capabilities, they are likely to accept and integrate these tools into their workflows, provided that their key concerns are addressed. This aligns with Hypothesis 5, indicating that frontline negotiators are likely to accept and integrate LLM tools into their workflows if these tools prove to be reliable, accurate, and address key concerns.</p>

<div class="ltx_para" id="A1.SS10.SSS2.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="A1.SS10.SSS2.p1.1">However, negotiators expressed concerns about the embedded Western bias within LLM like ChatGPT, which significantly impacts their utility in diverse cultural contexts. One negotiator highlighted that the current system, designed to support negotiation teams, predominantly reflects the perspectives of its creators—individuals with a specific level of English proficiency, education, and cultural understanding. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="A1.SS10.SSS2.p1.1.1">“With bias, with certain bias, and so on.”</span> (P12) This inherent bias is problematic because the tool is intended for field teams worldwide, not just the developers. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="A1.SS10.SSS2.p1.1.2">“You know, this is meant to be useful for them, not for me to be honest.”</span> (P12)</p>
</div>
<div class="ltx_para" id="A1.SS10.SSS2.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="A1.SS10.SSS2.p2.1">To address this, it is crucial to collect feedback from a broad range of users, especially from those in non-Western settings such as Nigeria and Myanmar. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="A1.SS10.SSS2.p2.1.1">“You need a lot, a lot of feedback, but not from us, not from us white people based in Barcelona. No, you really need to go to Nigeria, to Myanmar, and talk to the field teams and get their inputs on all these.”</span> The bias within the LLM not only potentially affects users from non-Western backgrounds but also Western users, as negotiations often occur across different cultural boundaries. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="A1.SS10.SSS2.p2.1.2">“But to me, yeah, you really want to avoid that bias. I don’t want to just draw information from a Western point of view, when I can draw information from that context or country [of where the negotiatons happen].”</span> (P12)</p>

More public education about the limitations and benefits of these tools will help better integrate LLMs into negotiators’ workflow. “I feel if there were loads of people who understood it a lot better, they’d be able to [feel better about using LLM in negotiation], because we all have these myths about what this stands for. So people like the public, they draw in a myth, and then they’re worried about it.

<div class="ltx_para" id="A1.SS10.SSS4.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="A1.SS10.SSS4.p1.1">Similar to other AI tools, negotiators are concerned over LLM’s accuracy in negotiation tasks. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="A1.SS10.SSS4.p1.1.1">“This is talking about my experience, but you cannot depend on it entirely 100%, because it’s still a tool.”</span> (P2) Often times confusing or inaccurate answers force the users to consider the reasons behind LLMs’ generation of such answers.
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="A1.SS10.SSS4.p1.1.2">“When I’m putting like this question to AI, ‘tell me, what are the major milestone dates in Greek history?’ AI might come up with 2 different set of milestones. So my question is, what’s the backend of these results? To which extent should I rely on it?”</span> (P3)
Another negotiator mentioned a similar point, citing that without knowing the source of why LLM generates certain answers, they are not able to rely on these systems. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="A1.SS10.SSS4.p1.1.3">“what information is the AI basing this on?

<p class="ltx_p" id="A1.SS10.SSS4.p2.1">Current LLMs do not explicitly attach what training data or information in the prompt made them to generate certain content. Due to this constraint, negotiators recommend constant checks and balances on the certainties that the LLM articulates.</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="A1.SS10.SSS4.p5.1">Additionally, negotiators recognize that while LLMs may not always produce accurate results, these outputs can still serve as a significant source of inspiration, as discussed in section <a class="ltx_ref" href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20195v2#A1.SS9.SSS2" title="A.9.2 Support argument ideation/ devil’s advocate ‣ A.9 Opportunities for LLM in humanitarian negotiation ‣ Appendix A Appendix ‣ Using Large Language Models for Humanitarian Frontline Negotiation: Opportunities and Considerations"><span class="ltx_text ltx_ref_tag">A.9.2</span></a>. Participants expressed confidence in their ability to discern and correct any inaccuracies, viewing the tool’s input as a starting point for deeper reflection and ideation. One negotiator explained, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="A1.SS10.SSS4.p5.1.1">“Even if AI is not right, we can tell that’s not right. Because of this reason, it’s totally okay when things are not correct, because it allows us to realize what we actually think, and challenges our preconceived notions or ideas. This, I think, is excellent even in just making us think more about what do we believe, and have we really thought about all of the steps and the key elements.”</span> They likened the AI to an <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="A1.SS10.SSS4.p5.1.2">“aspiring partner”</span> that, despite its flaws, can stimulate further questioning and refinement of their ideas (P4). For example, <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="A1.SS10.SSS4.p5.1.3">“I will sometimes put a transcript from a discussion in preparing for negotiations.

<div class="ltx_para" id="A1.SS10.SSS5.p1">
<p class="ltx_p" id="A1.SS10.SSS5.p1.1">LLM may not and should not replace the human side of negotiation. Negotiators argued that process in negotiation is inherently human centered.
<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="A1.SS10.SSS5.p1.1.1">“And a big part of most negotiations continues to be the human side, the human touch in the relationship between the 2 negotiators that are able to reach an agreement, and then even convince their own people that this is a good thing to go now.”</span> (P10) Even for information retreival, which is considered tasks where automation plays a big part in, some information is not readily online. For example, information about non-state armed groups requires the negotiators to gather information through in person meetings. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="A1.SS10.SSS5.p1.1.2">“ If it’s with local non0state armed groups, we won’t find very much history of them online.”</span> (P4) Other negotiators confirmed the in-person labor that they have to go through. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="A1.SS10.SSS5.p1.1.3">“The the key part of my job is actually to tour the region and engage with different levels [of groups].

<div class="ltx_para" id="A1.SS10.SSS5.p2">
<p class="ltx_p" id="A1.SS10.SSS5.p2.1">In addition to the source of information itself, the way that negotiators prepare information to feed into ChatGPT requires considerate human effort as well. For example, meeting notes, emails or phone call records have to be prepared into documents before they can be utilized. Depending on the negotiators, there may not even be structured notes. This way, using LLMs may create extra work for negotiators who do not prepare structured notes. After being shown the video of the Iceberg tool, P11 noted <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="A1.SS10.SSS5.p2.1.1">“if this [case file put into ChatGPT] originates from already notes or meetings … I think sometimes we don’t have those notes. […] I have a phone call. I write 2 points. Then I make another phone call. I follow up… So I wouldn’t have the script, the source for this [to be put into ChatGPT]. […] I don’t know how well one has to write the original documents for ChatGPT, to produce a good iceberg, for example. So the UN would would have plenty of meeting notes like this, because there are always people who do it. I personally have more of my notebooks […] and I make more action points. I don’t write structured notes. […] I guess people in the field may be not as structured. Sometimes you have confidential meetings that have no notes at all.</span> (P11) They continued to mention that potentially the desire to use ChatGPT can make one more organized, because ChatGPT requires text input. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="A1.SS10.SSS5.p2.1.2"> “On the other hand, it may also enable a negotiator, who is maybe all over the place to be more structured. And so it can be a positive thing. I don’t know how many and how many have produced the notes. […]”</span> (P11) Another negotiator pointed out the limitations faced by some of their colleagues: <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="A1.SS10.SSS5.p2.1.3">“Our negotiators are usually locally recruited staff that have very basic [limited] skills to interact with with AI, and also not the best skills in English, for instance. Or also be able to do proper reports that that are able to give AI to, you know the tools, to be able to analyze properly a situation.”</span> (P10)</p>

<p class="ltx_p" id="A1.SS10.SSS5.p3.1">These concerns support Hypothesis 4, which addresses the ethical and practical limitations of deploying LLMs in humanitarian negotiations. The human-centered nature of negotiation processes and the varying levels of preparation and technical skills among negotiators underscore the necessity for human oversight and the complementary use of LLMs rather than full automation.</p>

<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="A1.SS10.SSS6.p1.1.1">“I think that all these tools will shrink our brains because we will start relying on them. Like, it’s the same as with GPS. Ever since it’s been in use. We started to think about, where do we go? So we are blindly relying on automated maps. And then that is how orientation decreases our observation of the environment. We stopped noticing importance roots. You’re just out of sudden, you are there? How? You don’t know, because machine was leading you.”</span> (P3) Specifically, insights may come from the manual process of conducting the analysis. <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_italic" id="A1.SS10.SSS6.p1.1.2">“I think it’s important to do your own analysis. I think that information and intelligence comes from doing proper analysis and and getting yourself to a certain spot. So I mean I do use ChatGPT to do summaries for me. My worry is lack of engagement in the analysis.”</span> (P4)</p>
