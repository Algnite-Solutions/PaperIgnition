2404.07738v2	ResearchAgent: Iterative Research Idea Generation over Scientific Literature with Large Language Models . The pace of scientific research, vital for improving human life, is complex, slow, and needs specialized expertise. Meanwhile, novel, impactful research often stems from both a deep understanding of prior work, and a cross-pollination of ideas across domains and fields. To enhance the productivity of researchers, we propose ResearchAgent, which leverages the encyclopedic knowledge and linguistic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist them in their work. This system automatically defines novel problems, proposes methods and designs experiments, while iteratively refining them based on the feedback from collaborative LLM-powered reviewing agents. Specifically, starting with a core scientific paper, ResearchAgent is augmented not only with relevant publications by connecting information over an academic graph but also entities retrieved from a knowledge store derived from shared underlying concepts mined across numerous papers. Then, mimicking a scientific approach to improving ideas with peer discussions, we leverage multiple LLM-based ReviewingAgents that provide reviews and feedback via iterative revision processes. These reviewing agents are instantiated with human preference-aligned LLMs whose criteria for evaluation are elicited from actual human judgments via LLM prompting. We experimentally validate our ResearchAgent on scientific publications across multiple disciplines, showing its effectiveness in generating novel, clear, and valid ideas based on both human and model-based evaluation results. Our initial foray into AI-mediated scientific research has important implications for the development of future systems aimed at supporting researchers in their ideation and operationalization of novel work.
2506.14086v1	InsertRank: LLMs can reason over BM25 scores to Improve Listwise Reranking . Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant strides across various information retrieval tasks, particularly as rerankers, owing to their strong generalization and knowledge-transfer capabilities acquired from extensive pretraining. In parallel, the rise of LLM-based chat interfaces has raised user expectations, encouraging users to pose more complex queries that necessitate retrieval by ``reasoning'' over documents rather than through simple keyword matching or semantic similarity. While some recent efforts have exploited reasoning abilities of LLMs for reranking such queries, considerable potential for improvement remains. In that regards, we introduce InsertRank, an LLM-based reranker that leverages lexical signals like BM25 scores during reranking to further improve retrieval performance. InsertRank demonstrates improved retrieval effectiveness on -- BRIGHT, a reasoning benchmark spanning 12 diverse domains, and R2MED, a specialized medical reasoning retrieval benchmark spanning 8 different tasks. We conduct an exhaustive evaluation and several ablation studies and demonstrate that InsertRank consistently improves retrieval effectiveness across multiple families of LLMs, including GPT, Gemini, and Deepseek models. %In addition, we also conduct ablation studies on normalization by varying the scale of the BM25 scores, and positional bias by shuffling the order of the documents. With Deepseek-R1, InsertRank achieves a score of 37.5 on the BRIGHT benchmark. and 51.1 on the R2MED benchmark, surpassing previous methods.
2506.14407v2	ImpliRet: Benchmarking the Implicit Fact Retrieval Challenge . Retrieval systems are central to many NLP pipelines, but often rely on surface-level cues such as keyword overlap and lexical semantic similarity. To evaluate retrieval beyond these shallow signals, recent benchmarks introduce reasoning-heavy queries; however, they primarily shift the burden to query-side processing techniques -- like prompting or multi-hop retrieval -- that can help resolve complexity. In contrast, we present ImpliRet, a benchmark that shifts the reasoning challenge to document-side processing: The queries are simple, but relevance depends on facts stated implicitly in documents through temporal (e.g., resolving "two days ago"), arithmetic, and world knowledge relationships. We evaluate a range of sparse and dense retrievers, all of which struggle in this setting: the best nDCG@10 is only 14.91%. We also test whether long-context models can overcome this limitation. But even with a short context of only thirty documents, including the positive document, GPT-o4-mini scores only 55.54%, showing that document-side reasoning remains a challenge. Our codes are available at: github.com/ZeinabTaghavi/IMPLIRET
2506.14901v1	Combining Constrained and Unconstrained Decoding via Boosting: BoostCD and Its Application to Information Extraction . Many recent approaches to structured NLP tasks use an autoregressive language model $M$ to map unstructured input text $x$ to output text $y$ representing structured objects (such as tuples, lists, trees, code, etc.), where the desired output structure is enforced via constrained decoding. During training, these approaches do not require the model to be aware of the constraints, which are merely implicit in the training outputs $y$. This is advantageous as it allows for dynamic constraints without requiring retraining, but can lead to low-quality output during constrained decoding at test time. We overcome this problem with Boosted Constrained Decoding (BoostCD), which combines constrained and unconstrained decoding in two phases: Phase 1 decodes from the base model $M$ twice, in constrained and unconstrained mode, obtaining two weak predictions. In phase 2, a learned autoregressive boosted model combines the two weak predictions into one final prediction. The mistakes made by the base model with vs. without constraints tend to be complementary, which the boosted model learns to exploit for improved performance. We demonstrate the power of BoostCD by applying it to closed information extraction. Our model, BoostIE, outperforms prior approaches both in and out of distribution, addressing several common errors identified in those approaches.
2506.15745v1	InfiniPot-V: Memory-Constrained KV Cache Compression for Streaming Video Understanding . Modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can reason over hour-long video, yet their key-value (KV) cache grows linearly with time--quickly exceeding the fixed memory of phones, AR glasses, and edge robots. Prior compression schemes either assume the whole video and user query are available offline or must first build the full cache, so memory still scales with stream length. InfiniPot-V is the first training-free, query-agnostic framework that enforces a hard, length-independent memory cap for streaming video understanding. During video encoding it monitors the cache and, once a user-set threshold is reached, runs a lightweight compression pass that (i) removes temporally redundant tokens via Temporal-axis Redundancy (TaR) metric and (ii) keeps semantically significant tokens via Value-Norm (VaN) ranking. Across four open-source MLLMs and four long-video and two streaming-video benchmarks, InfiniPot-V cuts peak GPU memory by up to 94%, sustains real-time generation, and matches or surpasses full-cache accuracy--even in multi-turn dialogues. By dissolving the KV cache bottleneck without retraining or query knowledge, InfiniPot-V closes the gap for on-device streaming video assistants.
2506.15862v1	MoR: Better Handling Diverse Queries with a Mixture of Sparse, Dense, and Human Retrievers . Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) is powerful, but its effectiveness hinges on which retrievers we use and how. Different retrievers offer distinct, often complementary signals: BM25 captures lexical matches; dense retrievers, semantic similarity. Yet in practice, we typically fix a single retriever based on heuristics, which fails to generalize across diverse information needs. Can we dynamically select and integrate multiple retrievers for each individual query, without the need for manual selection? In our work, we validate this intuition with quantitative analysis and introduce mixture of retrievers: a zero-shot, weighted combination of heterogeneous retrievers. Extensive experiments show that such mixtures are effective and efficient: Despite totaling just 0.8B parameters, this mixture outperforms every individual retriever and even larger 7B models by +10.8% and +3.9% on average, respectively. Further analysis also shows that this mixture framework can help incorporate specialized non-oracle human information sources as retrievers to achieve good collaboration, with a 58.9% relative performance improvement over simulated humans alone.
2506.15948v1	Information-computation trade-offs in non-linear transforms . In this work, we explore the interplay between information and computation in non-linear transform-based compression for broad classes of modern information-processing tasks. We first investigate two emerging nonlinear data transformation frameworks for image compression: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and 2D Gaussian Splatting (GS). We analyze their representational properties, behavior under lossy compression, and convergence dynamics. Our results highlight key trade-offs between INR's compact, resolution-flexible neural field representations and GS's highly parallelizable, spatially interpretable fitting, providing insights for future hybrid and compression-aware frameworks. Next, we introduce the textual transform that enables efficient compression at ultra-low bitrate regimes and simultaneously enhances human perceptual satisfaction. When combined with the concept of denoising via lossy compression, the textual transform becomes a powerful tool for denoising tasks. Finally, we present a Lempel-Ziv (LZ78) "transform", a universal method that, when applied to any member of a broad compressor family, produces new compressors that retain the asymptotic universality guarantees of the LZ78 algorithm. Collectively, these three transforms illuminate the fundamental trade-offs between coding efficiency and computational cost. We discuss how these insights extend beyond compression to tasks such as classification, denoising, and generative AI, suggesting new pathways for using non-linear transformations to balance resource constraints and performance.
2506.16146v2	Neural Prioritisation for Web Crawling . Given the vast scale of the Web, crawling prioritisation techniques based on link graph traversal, popularity, link analysis, and textual content are frequently applied to surface documents that are most likely to be valuable. While existing techniques are effective for keyword-based search, both retrieval methods and user search behaviours are shifting from keyword-based matching to natural language semantic matching. The remarkable success of applying semantic matching and quality signals during ranking leads us to hypothesize that crawling could be improved by prioritizing Web pages with high semantic quality. To investigate this, we propose a semantic quality-driven prioritisation technique to enhance the effectiveness of crawling and align the crawler behaviour with recent shift towards natural language search. We embed semantic understanding directly into the crawling process -- leveraging recent neural semantic quality estimators to prioritise the crawling frontier -- with the goal of surfacing content that is semantically rich and valuable for modern search needs. Our experiments on the English subset of ClueWeb22-B and the Researchy Questions query set show that, compared to existing crawling techniques, neural crawling policies significantly improve harvest rate, maxNDCG, and search effectiveness during the early stages of crawling. Meanwhile, crawlers based on our proposed neural policies maintain comparable search performance on keyword queries from the MS MARCO Web Search query set. While this work does not propose a definitive and complete solution, it presents a forward-looking perspective on Web crawling and opens the door to a new line of research on leveraging semantic analysis to effectively align crawlers with the ongoing shift toward natural language search.
2506.16450v1	How Far Can Off-the-Shelf Multimodal Large Language Models Go in Online Episodic Memory Question Answering? . We investigate whether off-the-shelf Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can tackle Online Episodic-Memory Video Question Answering (OEM-VQA) without additional training. Our pipeline converts a streaming egocentric video into a lightweight textual memory, only a few kilobytes per minute, via an MLLM descriptor module, and answers multiple-choice questions by querying this memory with an LLM reasoner module. On the QAEgo4D-Closed benchmark, our best configuration attains 56.0% accuracy with 3.6 kB per minute storage, matching the performance of dedicated state-of-the-art systems while being 10**4/10**5 times more memory-efficient. Extensive ablations provides insights into the role of each component and design choice, and highlight directions of improvement for future research.
2506.16552v1	Revela: Dense Retriever Learning via Language Modeling . Dense retrievers play a vital role in accessing external and specialized knowledge to augment language models (LMs). Training dense retrievers typically requires annotated query-document pairs, which are costly and hard to obtain in specialized domains such as code-motivating growing interest in self-supervised retriever learning. Since LMs are trained to capture token-level dependencies through a self-supervised learning objective (i.e., next-token prediction), we can analogously cast retrieval as learning dependencies among chunks of tokens. This analogy naturally leads to the question: How can we adapt self-supervised learning objectives in the spirit of language modeling to train retrievers?   To answer this question, we introduce Revela, a unified and scalable training framework for self-supervised retriever learning via language modeling. Revela models semantic dependencies among documents by conditioning next-token prediction on both local and cross-document context through an in-batch attention mechanism. This attention is weighted by retriever-computed similarity scores, enabling the retriever to be optimized as part of language modeling. We evaluate Revela on both general-domain (BEIR) and domain-specific (CoIR) benchmarks across various retriever backbones. At a comparable parameter scale, Revela outperforms the previous best method with absolute improvements of 5.2 % (18.3 % relative) and 5.6 % (14.4 % relative) on NDCG@10, respectively, underscoring its effectiveness. Performance increases with model size, highlighting both the scalability of our approach and its promise for self-supervised retriever learning.
2506.16679v1	How to Train your Text-to-Image Model: Evaluating Design Choices for Synthetic Training Captions . Training data is at the core of any successful text-to-image models. The quality and descriptiveness of image text are crucial to a model's performance. Given the noisiness and inconsistency in web-scraped datasets, recent works shifted towards synthetic training captions. While this setup is generally believed to produce more capable models, current literature does not provide any insights into its design choices. This study closes this gap by systematically investigating how different synthetic captioning strategies impact the downstream performance of text-to-image models. Our experiments demonstrate that dense, high-quality captions enhance text alignment but may introduce trade-offs in output aesthetics and diversity. Conversely, captions of randomized lengths yield balanced improvements across aesthetics and alignment without compromising sample diversity. We also demonstrate that varying caption distributions introduce significant shifts in the output bias of a trained model. Our findings underscore the importance of caption design in achieving optimal model performance and provide practical insights for more effective training data strategies in text-to-image generation.
2506.17019v1	Instituto de Telecomunicações at IWSLT 2025: Aligning Small-Scale Speech and Language Models for Speech-to-Text Learning . This paper presents the IT-IST submission to the IWSLT 2025 Shared Task on Instruction Following Speech Processing. We submit results for the Short Track, i.e., speech recognition, translation, and spoken question answering. Our model is a unified speech-to-text model that integrates a pre-trained continuous speech encoder and text decoder through a first phase of modality alignment and a second phase of instruction fine-tuning. Crucially, we focus on using small-scale language model backbones (< 2B) and restrict to high-quality, CC-BY data along with synthetic data generation to supplement existing resources.
2506.17372v1	Multimodal Political Bias Identification and Neutralization . Due to the presence of political echo chambers, it becomes imperative to detect and remove subjective bias and emotionally charged language from both the text and images of political articles. However, prior work has focused on solely the text portion of the bias rather than both the text and image portions. This is a problem because the images are just as powerful of a medium to communicate information as text is. To that end, we present a model that leverages both text and image bias which consists of four different steps. Image Text Alignment focuses on semantically aligning images based on their bias through CLIP models. Image Bias Scoring determines the appropriate bias score of images via a ViT classifier. Text De-Biasing focuses on detecting biased words and phrases and neutralizing them through BERT models. These three steps all culminate to the final step of debiasing, which replaces the text and the image with neutralized or reduced counterparts, which for images is done by comparing the bias scores. The results so far indicate that this approach is promising, with the text debiasing strategy being able to identify many potential biased words and phrases, and the ViT model showcasing effective training. The semantic alignment model also is efficient. However, more time, particularly in training, and resources are needed to obtain better results. A human evaluation portion was also proposed to ensure semantic consistency of the newly generated text and images.
2506.17580v1	Context-Aware Scientific Knowledge Extraction on Linked Open Data using Large Language Models . The exponential growth of scientific literature challenges researchers extracting and synthesizing knowledge. Traditional search engines return many sources without direct, detailed answers, while general-purpose LLMs may offer concise responses that lack depth or omit current information. LLMs with search capabilities are also limited by context window, yielding short, incomplete answers. This paper introduces WISE (Workflow for Intelligent Scientific Knowledge Extraction), a system addressing these limits by using a structured workflow to extract, refine, and rank query-specific knowledge. WISE uses an LLM-powered, tree-based architecture to refine data, focusing on query-aligned, context-aware, and non-redundant information. Dynamic scoring and ranking prioritize unique contributions from each source, and adaptive stopping criteria minimize processing overhead. WISE delivers detailed, organized answers by systematically exploring and synthesizing knowledge from diverse sources. Experiments on HBB gene-associated diseases demonstrate WISE reduces processed text by over 80% while achieving significantly higher recall over baselines like search engines and other LLM-based approaches. ROUGE and BLEU metrics reveal WISE's output is more unique than other systems, and a novel level-based metric shows it provides more in-depth information. We also explore how the WISE workflow can be adapted for diverse domains like drug discovery, material science, and social science, enabling efficient knowledge extraction and synthesis from unstructured scientific papers and web sources.
2506.17623v1	Can Generated Images Serve as a Viable Modality for Text-Centric Multimodal Learning? . A significant ``modality gap" exists between the abundance of text-only data and the increasing power of multimodal models. This work systematically investigates whether images generated on-the-fly by Text-to-Image (T2I) models can serve as a valuable complementary modality for text-centric tasks. Through a comprehensive evaluation framework on text classification, we analyze the impact of critical variables, including T2I model quality, prompt engineering strategies, and multimodal fusion architectures. Our findings demonstrate that this``synthetic perception" can yield significant performance gains, even when augmenting strong large language model baselines. However, we find the effectiveness of this approach is highly conditional, depending critically on the semantic alignment between text and the generated image, the inherent ``visual groundability" of the task, and the generative fidelity of the T2I model. Our work establishes the first rigorous benchmark for this paradigm, providing a clear analysis of its potential and current limitations, and demonstrating its viability as a pathway to enrich language understanding in traditionally unimodal scenarios.
2506.17639v1	RLRC: Reinforcement Learning-based Recovery for Compressed Vision-Language-Action Models . Vision-Language-Action models (VLA) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities and promising potential in solving complex robotic manipulation tasks. However, their substantial parameter sizes and high inference latency pose significant challenges for real-world deployment, particularly on resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address this issue, we begin by conducting an extensive empirical study to explore the effectiveness of model compression techniques when applied to VLAs. Building on the insights gained from these preliminary experiments, we propose RLRC, a three-stage recovery method for compressed VLAs, including structured pruning, performance recovery based on SFT and RL, and further quantization. RLRC achieves up to an 8x reduction in memory usage and a 2.3x improvement in inference throughput, while maintaining or even surpassing the original VLA's task success rate. Extensive experiments show that RLRC consistently outperforms existing compression baselines, demonstrating strong potential for on-device deployment of VLAs.

2506.18311v1	Enhancing Document Retrieval in COVID-19 Research: Leveraging Large Language Models for Hidden Relation Extraction . In recent years, with the appearance of the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous publications relevant to this disease have been issued. Because of the massive volume of publications, an efficient retrieval system is necessary to provide researchers with useful information if an unexpected pandemic happens so suddenly, like COVID-19. In this work, we present a method to help the retrieval system, the Covrelex-SE system, to provide more high-quality search results. We exploited the power of the large language models (LLMs) to extract the hidden relationships inside the unlabeled publication that cannot be found by the current parsing tools that the system is using. Since then, help the system to have more useful information during retrieval progress.
2506.18316v1	Team LA at SCIDOCA shared task 2025: Citation Discovery via relation-based zero-shot retrieval . The Citation Discovery Shared Task focuses on predicting the correct citation from a given candidate pool for a given paragraph. The main challenges stem from the length of the abstract paragraphs and the high similarity among candidate abstracts, making it difficult to determine the exact paper to cite. To address this, we develop a system that first retrieves the top-k most similar abstracts based on extracted relational features from the given paragraph. From this subset, we leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) to accurately identify the most relevant citation. We evaluate our framework on the training dataset provided by the SCIDOCA 2025 organizers, demonstrating its effectiveness in citation prediction.
2506.18898v1	Vision as a Dialect: Unifying Visual Understanding and Generation via Text-Aligned Representations . This paper presents a multimodal framework that attempts to unify visual understanding and generation within a shared discrete semantic representation. At its core is the Text-Aligned Tokenizer (TA-Tok), which converts images into discrete tokens using a text-aligned codebook projected from a large language model's (LLM) vocabulary. By integrating vision and text into a unified space with an expanded vocabulary, our multimodal LLM, Tar, enables cross-modal input and output through a shared interface, without the need for modality-specific designs. Additionally, we propose scale-adaptive encoding and decoding to balance efficiency and visual detail, along with a generative de-tokenizer to produce high-fidelity visual outputs. To address diverse decoding needs, we utilize two complementary de-tokenizers: a fast autoregressive model and a diffusion-based model. To enhance modality fusion, we investigate advanced pre-training tasks, demonstrating improvements in both visual understanding and generation. Experiments across benchmarks show that Tar matches or surpasses existing multimodal LLM methods, achieving faster convergence and greater training efficiency. Code, models, and data are available at https://tar.csuhan.com
2506.18959v3	From Web Search towards Agentic Deep Research: Incentivizing Search with Reasoning Agents . Information retrieval is a cornerstone of modern knowledge acquisition, enabling billions of queries each day across diverse domains. However, traditional keyword-based search engines are increasingly inadequate for handling complex, multi-step information needs. Our position is that Large Language Models (LLMs), endowed with reasoning and agentic capabilities, are ushering in a new paradigm termed Agentic Deep Research. These systems transcend conventional information search techniques by tightly integrating autonomous reasoning, iterative retrieval, and information synthesis into a dynamic feedback loop. We trace the evolution from static web search to interactive, agent-based systems that plan, explore, and learn. We also introduce a test-time scaling law to formalize the impact of computational depth on reasoning and search. Supported by benchmark results and the rise of open-source implementations, we demonstrate that Agentic Deep Research not only significantly outperforms existing approaches, but is also poised to become the dominant paradigm for future information seeking. All the related resources, including industry products, research papers, benchmark datasets, and open-source implementations, are collected for the community in https://github.com/DavidZWZ/Awesome-Deep-Research.
2506.19389v1	Emergence of Text Readability in Vision Language Models . We investigate how the ability to recognize textual content within images emerges during the training of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Our analysis reveals a critical phenomenon: the ability to read textual information in a given image \textbf{(text readability)} emerges abruptly after substantial training iterations, in contrast to semantic content understanding which develops gradually from the early stages of training. This delayed emergence may reflect how contrastive learning tends to initially prioritize general semantic understanding, with text-specific symbolic processing developing later. Interestingly, the ability to match images with rendered text develops even slower, indicating a deeper need for semantic integration. These findings highlight the need for tailored training strategies to accelerate robust text comprehension in VLMs, laying the groundwork for future research on optimizing multimodal learning.
2506.19743v1	NEAR$^2$: A Nested Embedding Approach to Efficient Product Retrieval and Ranking . E-commerce information retrieval (IR) systems struggle to simultaneously achieve high accuracy in interpreting complex user queries and maintain efficient processing of vast product catalogs. The dual challenge lies in precisely matching user intent with relevant products while managing the computational demands of real-time search across massive inventories. In this paper, we propose a Nested Embedding Approach to product Retrieval and Ranking, called NEAR$^2$, which can achieve up to $12$ times efficiency in embedding size at inference time while introducing no extra cost in training and improving performance in accuracy for various encoder-based Transformer models. We validate our approach using different loss functions for the retrieval and ranking task, including multiple negative ranking loss and online contrastive loss, on four different test sets with various IR challenges such as short and implicit queries. Our approach achieves an improved performance over a smaller embedding dimension, compared to any existing models.
2506.20155v1	Towards Efficient Exemplar Based Image Editing with Multimodal VLMs . Text-to-Image Diffusion models have enabled a wide array of image editing applications. However, capturing all types of edits through text alone can be challenging and cumbersome. The ambiguous nature of certain image edits is better expressed through an exemplar pair, i.e., a pair of images depicting an image before and after an edit respectively. In this work, we tackle exemplar-based image editing -- the task of transferring an edit from an exemplar pair to a content image(s), by leveraging pretrained text-to-image diffusion models and multimodal VLMs. Even though our end-to-end pipeline is optimization-free, our experiments demonstrate that it still outperforms baselines on multiple types of edits while being ~4x faster.
2506.20494v1	Multimodal Representation Learning and Fusion . Multi-modal learning is a fast growing area in artificial intelligence. It tries to help machines understand complex things by combining information from different sources, like images, text, and audio. By using the strengths of each modality, multi-modal learning allows AI systems to build stronger and richer internal representations. These help machines better interpretation, reasoning, and making decisions in real-life situations. This field includes core techniques such as representation learning (to get shared features from different data types), alignment methods (to match information across modalities), and fusion strategies (to combine them by deep learning models). Although there has been good progress, some major problems still remain. Like dealing with different data formats, missing or incomplete inputs, and defending against adversarial attacks. Researchers now are exploring new methods, such as unsupervised or semi-supervised learning, AutoML tools, to make models more efficient and easier to scale. And also more attention on designing better evaluation metrics or building shared benchmarks, make it easier to compare model performance across tasks and domains. As the field continues to grow, multi-modal learning is expected to improve many areas: computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and healthcare. In the future, it may help to build AI systems that can understand the world in a way more like humans, flexible, context aware, and able to deal with real-world complexity.
2506.20608v1	AI Assistants to Enhance and Exploit the PETSc Knowledge Base . Generative AI, especially through large language models (LLMs), is transforming how technical knowledge can be accessed, reused, and extended. PETSc, a widely used numerical library for high-performance scientific computing, has accumulated a rich but fragmented knowledge base over its three decades of development, spanning source code, documentation, mailing lists, GitLab issues, Discord conversations, technical papers, and more. Much of this knowledge remains informal and inaccessible to users and new developers. To activate and utilize this knowledge base more effectively, the PETSc team has begun building an LLM-powered system that combines PETSc content with custom LLM tools -- including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), reranking algorithms, and chatbots -- to assist users, support developers, and propose updates to formal documentation. This paper presents initial experiences designing and evaluating these tools, focusing on system architecture, using RAG and reranking for PETSc-specific information, evaluation methodologies for various LLMs and embedding models, and user interface design. Leveraging the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility resources, we analyze how LLM responses can enhance the development and use of numerical software, with an initial focus on scalable Krylov solvers. Our goal is to establish an extensible framework for knowledge-centered AI in scientific software, enabling scalable support, enriched documentation, and enhanced workflows for research and development. We conclude by outlining directions for expanding this system into a robust, evolving platform that advances software ecosystems to accelerate scientific discovery.
2506.20844v2	The Next Phase of Scientific Fact-Checking: Advanced Evidence Retrieval from Complex Structured Academic Papers . Scientific fact-checking aims to determine the veracity of scientific claims by retrieving and analysing evidence from research literature. The problem is inherently more complex than general fact-checking since it must accommodate the evolving nature of scientific knowledge, the structural complexity of academic literature and the challenges posed by long-form, multimodal scientific expression. However, existing approaches focus on simplified versions of the problem based on small-scale datasets consisting of abstracts rather than full papers, thereby avoiding the distinct challenges associated with processing complete documents. This paper examines the limitations of current scientific fact-checking systems and reveals the many potential features and resources that could be exploited to advance their performance. It identifies key research challenges within evidence retrieval, including (1) evidence-driven retrieval that addresses semantic limitations and topic imbalance (2) time-aware evidence retrieval with citation tracking to mitigate outdated information, (3) structured document parsing to leverage long-range context, (4) handling complex scientific expressions, including tables, figures, and domain-specific terminology and (5) assessing the credibility of scientific literature. Preliminary experiments were conducted to substantiate these challenges and identify potential solutions. This perspective paper aims to advance scientific fact-checking with a specialised IR system tailored for real-world applications.
2506.21146v1	Linearity-based neural network compression . In neural network compression, most current methods reduce unnecessary parameters by measuring importance and redundancy. To augment already highly optimized existing solutions, we propose linearity-based compression as a novel way to reduce weights in a neural network. It is based on the intuition that with ReLU-like activation functions, neurons that are almost always activated behave linearly, allowing for merging of subsequent layers. We introduce the theory underlying this compression and evaluate our approach experimentally. Our novel method achieves a lossless compression down to 1/4 of the original model size in over the majority of tested models. Applying our method on already importance-based pruned models shows very little interference between different types of compression, demonstrating the option of successful combination of techniques. Overall, our work lays the foundation for a new type of compression method that enables smaller and ultimately more efficient neural network models.
2506.21184v1	Task-Aware KV Compression For Cost-Effective Long Video Understanding . Long-video understanding (LVU) remains a severe challenge for existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs), primarily due to the prohibitive computational cost. Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate this issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly preserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two key operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the MLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs: low-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and high-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second one is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage, Video-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while using H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully utilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness. Video-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and directly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L with a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VNBench. Our experiment result shows that Video-X^2L outperforms existing KV-compression methods by a huge advantage while substantially saving the computation cost.
2506.21294v1	Detecting Referring Expressions in Visually Grounded Dialogue with Autoregressive Language Models . In this paper, we explore the use of a text-only, autoregressive language modeling approach for the extraction of referring expressions from visually grounded dialogue. More specifically, the aim is to investigate the extent to which the linguistic context alone can inform the detection of mentions that have a (visually perceivable) referent in the visual context of the conversation. To this end, we adapt a pretrained large language model (LLM) to perform a relatively course-grained annotation of mention spans in unfolding conversations by demarcating mention span boundaries in text via next-token prediction. Our findings indicate that even when using a moderately sized LLM, relatively small datasets, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, a text-only approach can be effective, highlighting the relative importance of the linguistic context for this task. Nevertheless, we argue that the task represents an inherently multimodal problem and discuss limitations fundamental to unimodal approaches.
2506.21625v1	Doc2SAR: A Synergistic Framework for High-Fidelity Extraction of Structure-Activity Relationships from Scientific Documents . Extracting molecular structure-activity relationships (SARs) from scientific literature and patents is essential for drug discovery and materials research. However, this task remains challenging due to heterogeneous document formats and limitations of existing methods. Specifically, rule-based approaches relying on rigid templates fail to generalize across diverse document layouts, while general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs) lack sufficient accuracy and reliability for specialized tasks, such as layout detection and optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR). To address these challenges, we introduce DocSAR-200, a rigorously annotated benchmark of 200 scientific documents designed specifically for evaluating SAR extraction methods. Additionally, we propose Doc2SAR, a novel synergistic framework that integrates domain-specific tools with MLLMs enhanced via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Extensive experiments demonstrate that Doc2SAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across various document types, significantly outperforming leading end-to-end baselines. Specifically, Doc2SAR attains an overall Table Recall of 80.78% on DocSAR-200, exceeding end2end GPT-4o by 51.48%. Furthermore, Doc2SAR demonstrates practical usability through efficient inference and is accompanied by a web app.
2506.21638v1	IRanker: Towards Ranking Foundation Model . Ranking tasks are ubiquitous, encompassing applications such as recommendation systems, LLM routing, and item re-ranking. We propose to unify these tasks using a single ranking foundation model (FM), as it eliminates the need for designing different models for each specific ranking task. However, unlike general supervision tasks in LLMs, ranking tasks do not have clear labels for supervision, posing great challenges to developing a ranking FM. To overcome these challenges, we propose IRanker, a ranking FM framework with reinforcement learning (RL) and iterative decoding. Our insight is to decompose the complex ranking task into an iterative decoding process that eliminates the worst candidate from the candidate pool step by step, which significantly reduces the output combinatorial space and better utilizes the limited context length during RL training. We meticulously train and comprehensively evaluate an IRanker-3B model on nine datasets across three scenarios: recommendation, routing, and passage ranking. The results show that a single IRanker-3B achieves state-of-the-art results on several datasets compared to models of similar size, and even surpasses the performance of larger models on certain datasets. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our RL design and the robustness of the iterative mechanism across different LLM sizes. Moreover, we conducted both in-domain and out-of-domain zero-shot generalization experiments, which showed that IRanker-3B achieved good generalization on in-domain ranking tasks compared to the base LLM by at least 5% improvement. Surprisingly, on out-of-domain generic LLM tasks, IRanker-3B outperformed the base model by at least 9% on GSM8K, IFEval, and MathQA. In addition, the thoughts generated by IRanker-3B during training could further enhance zero-shot LLM performance.
2506.21862v1	LLaVA-Scissor: Token Compression with Semantic Connected Components for Video LLMs . In this paper, we present LLaVA-Scissor, a training-free token compression strategy designed for video multimodal large language models. Previous methods mostly attempt to compress tokens based on attention scores, but fail to effectively capture all semantic regions and often lead to token redundancy. Differently, we propose to leverage the Semantic Connected Components (SCC) approach that assigns tokens to distinct semantic regions within the token set, ensuring comprehensive semantic coverage. The outcome is a two-step spatio-temporal token compression strategy that utilizes SCC in both spatial and temporal domains. This strategy can effectively compress tokens by representing the entire video with a set of non-overlapping semantic tokens. We conduct extensive evaluations of the token compression capabilities of LLaVA-Scissor across diverse video understanding benchmarks, including video question answering, long video understanding, and comprehensive multi-choices benchmarks. Experimental results show that the proposed LLaVA-Scissor outperforms other token compression methods, achieving superior performance in various video understanding benchmarks, particularly at low token retention ratios.

2506.22283v1	Rethinking Visual Token Reduction in LVLMs under Cross-modal Misalignment . Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) encode visual inputs as dense sequences of patch-level tokens to capture fine-grained semantics. These visual tokens often outnumber their textual counterparts by a large margin, leading to substantial computational overhead and limiting the scalability of LVLMs in practice. Previous efforts have explored visual token reduction either prior to or within the large language models (LLM). However, most in-LLM reduction approaches rely on text-conditioned interactions, implicitly assuming that textual tokens can reliably capture the importance of visual tokens. In this work, we revisit this assumption and reveal causal, semantic, and spatial forms of cross-modal misalignment. These misalignments undermine the effectiveness of text-guided visual token reduction. To address this, we introduce VisionDrop, a training-free, visual-only pruning framework that selects informative visual tokens based on intra-modal (visual-to-visual) attention, without relying on textual signals. To further suppress redundancy throughout the model hierarchy, we treat the visual encoder and the LLM as a unified system and design a progressive pruning pipeline. Our method performs dominant token selection and lightweight contextual merging at multiple stages, enabling fine-grained visual information to be retained even under aggressive token budgets. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show that VisionDrop achieves consistent improvements over existing methods, despite requiring no additional training or complex modifications. Its simple yet effective design enables efficient inference while preserving strong performance across tasks.
2506.22589v2	LIGHT: Multi-Modal Text Linking on Historical Maps . Text on historical maps provides valuable information for studies in history, economics, geography, and other related fields. Unlike structured or semi-structured documents, text on maps varies significantly in orientation, reading order, shape, and placement. Many modern methods can detect and transcribe text regions, but they struggle to effectively ``link'' the recognized text fragments, e.g., determining a multi-word place name. Existing layout analysis methods model word relationships to improve text understanding in structured documents, but they primarily rely on linguistic features and neglect geometric information, which is essential for handling map text. To address these challenges, we propose LIGHT, a novel multi-modal approach that integrates linguistic, image, and geometric features for linking text on historical maps. In particular, LIGHT includes a geometry-aware embedding module that encodes the polygonal coordinates of text regions to capture polygon shapes and their relative spatial positions on an image. LIGHT unifies this geometric information with the visual and linguistic token embeddings from LayoutLMv3, a pretrained layout analysis model. LIGHT uses the cross-modal information to predict the reading-order successor of each text instance directly with a bi-directional learning strategy that enhances sequence robustness. Experimental results show that LIGHT outperforms existing methods on the ICDAR 2024/2025 MapText Competition data, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-modal learning for historical map text linking.
2506.22636v1	ReCo: Reminder Composition Mitigates Hallucinations in Vision-Language Models . Vision Language Models (VLMs) show impressive capabilities in integrating and reasoning with both visual and language data. But these models make mistakes. A common finding -- similar to LLMs -- is their tendency to hallucinate, i.e., generate plausible sounding text which is not grounded in the visual input, or at worst, is contradictory. A growing consensus attributes this behavior to an over-reliance on language -- especially as the generation progresses, the model suffers from a ``fading memory effect'' with respect to the provided visual input. We study mechanisms by which this behavior can be controlled. Specifically, using ideas from geometric algebra and relational compositions, we propose the addition of a small, trainable module (named ReCo) on top of any VLM -- no other modification is needed. We show that such a lightweight module is able to mitigate the fading memory effect on three of the most widely used VLMs (InstructBLIP, LlaVA, MiniGPT4), where we see performance improvements on multiple benchmarks. Additionally, we show that our module can be combined with many of the other approaches for reducing hallucination where we achieve improved results for each one.
2506.23192v1	RiverText: A Python Library for Training and Evaluating Incremental Word Embeddings from Text Data Streams . Word embeddings have become essential components in various information retrieval and natural language processing tasks, such as ranking, document classification, and question answering. However, despite their widespread use, traditional word embedding models present a limitation in their static nature, which hampers their ability to adapt to the constantly evolving language patterns that emerge in sources such as social media and the web (e.g., new hashtags or brand names). To overcome this problem, incremental word embedding algorithms are introduced, capable of dynamically updating word representations in response to new language patterns and processing continuous data streams.   This paper presents RiverText, a Python library for training and evaluating incremental word embeddings from text data streams. Our tool is a resource for the information retrieval and natural language processing communities that work with word embeddings in streaming scenarios, such as analyzing social media. The library implements different incremental word embedding techniques, such as Skip-gram, Continuous Bag of Words, and Word Context Matrix, in a standardized framework. In addition, it uses PyTorch as its backend for neural network training. We have implemented a module that adapts existing intrinsic static word embedding evaluation tasks for word similarity and word categorization to a streaming setting. Finally, we compare the implemented methods with different hyperparameter settings and discuss the results. Our open-source library is available at https://github.com/dccuchile/rivertext.
2506.23443v1	Accessible Data Access and Analysis by People who are Blind or Have Low Vision . Our work aims to develop new assistive technologies that enable blind or low vision (BLV) people to explore and analyze data readily. At present, barriers exist for BLV people to explore and analyze data, restricting access to government, health and personal data, and limiting employment opportunities. This work explores the co-design and development of an innovative system to support data access, with a focus on the use of refreshable tactile displays (RTDs) and conversational agents. The envisaged system will use a combination of tactile graphics and speech to communicate with BLV users, and proactively assist with data analysis tasks. As well as addressing significant equity gaps, our work expects to produce innovations in assistive technology, multimodal interfaces, dialogue systems, and natural language understanding and generation.
2506.23639v1	Unified Multimodal Understanding via Byte-Pair Visual Encoding . Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in vision-language understanding, yet effectively aligning different modalities remains a fundamental challenge. We present a framework that unifies multimodal understanding by applying byte-pair encoding to visual tokens. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on modality-specific encoders, our method directly incorporates structural information into visual tokens, mirroring successful tokenization strategies in text-only language models. We introduce a priority-guided encoding scheme that considers both frequency and spatial consistency, coupled with a multi-stage training procedure based on curriculum-driven data composition. These enhancements enable the transformer model to better capture cross-modal relationships and reason with visual information. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate improved performance across diverse vision-language tasks. By bridging the gap between visual and textual representations, our approach contributes to the advancement of more capable and efficient multimodal foundation models.
2506.23670v1	Efficient Interleaved Speech Modeling through Knowledge Distillation . Current speech language models exceed the size and latency constraints of many deployment environments. We build compact, expressive speech generation models through layer-aligned distillation, matching hidden states, attention maps, and softened logits to compress large multimodal transformers by 3x with minimal loss in performance. We introduce TinyWave, a family of 2B-parameter models for speech-to-speech and interleaved speech-text generation, trained on 50,000 hours of public audio. TinyWave supports (i) speech-only generation using phonetic or expressive tokens and (ii) mixed speech-text continuations. Evaluation on Libri-Light shows TinyWave within 1.4 normalized perplexity points of its teacher. Accuracy on spoken StoryCloze and SALMon reaches 93-97% of the teacher's performance, outperforming size-matched baselines. These models are optimized for deployment on commodity hardware, enabling applications in real-time conversational agents, assistive technologies, and low-resource environments. We release models, training code, and evaluation scripts to support reproducible research on compact, expressive speech generation.
2506.23785v1	Visual Textualization for Image Prompted Object Detection . We propose VisTex-OVLM, a novel image prompted object detection method that introduces visual textualization -- a process that projects a few visual exemplars into the text feature space to enhance Object-level Vision-Language Models' (OVLMs) capability in detecting rare categories that are difficult to describe textually and nearly absent from their pre-training data, while preserving their pre-trained object-text alignment. Specifically, VisTex-OVLM leverages multi-scale textualizing blocks and a multi-stage fusion strategy to integrate visual information from visual exemplars, generating textualized visual tokens that effectively guide OVLMs alongside text prompts. Unlike previous methods, our method maintains the original architecture of OVLM, maintaining its generalization capabilities while enhancing performance in few-shot settings. VisTex-OVLM demonstrates superior performance across open-set datasets which have minimal overlap with OVLM's pre-training data and achieves state-of-the-art results on few-shot benchmarks PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO. The code will be released at https://github.com/WitGotFlg/VisTex-OVLM.
2507.00152v1	Table Understanding and (Multimodal) LLMs: A Cross-Domain Case Study on Scientific vs. Non-Scientific Data . Tables are among the most widely used tools for representing structured data in research, business, medicine, and education. Although LLMs demonstrate strong performance in downstream tasks, their efficiency in processing tabular data remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of both text-based and multimodal LLMs on table understanding tasks through a cross-domain and cross-modality evaluation. Specifically, we compare their performance on tables from scientific vs. non-scientific contexts and examine their robustness on tables represented as images vs. text. Additionally, we conduct an interpretability analysis to measure context usage and input relevance. We also introduce the TableEval benchmark, comprising 3017 tables from scholarly publications, Wikipedia, and financial reports, where each table is provided in five different formats: Image, Dictionary, HTML, XML, and LaTeX. Our findings indicate that while LLMs maintain robustness across table modalities, they face significant challenges when processing scientific tables.
2507.00454v1	ATSTrack: Enhancing Visual-Language Tracking by Aligning Temporal and Spatial Scales . A main challenge of Visual-Language Tracking (VLT) is the misalignment between visual inputs and language descriptions caused by target movement. Previous trackers have explored many effective feature modification methods to preserve more aligned features. However, an important yet unexplored factor ultimately hinders their capability, which is the inherent differences in the temporal and spatial scale of information between visual and language inputs. To address this issue, we propose a novel visual-language tracker that enhances the effect of feature modification by \textbf{A}ligning \textbf{T}emporal and \textbf{S}patial scale of different input components, named as \textbf{ATSTrack}. Specifically, we decompose each language description into phrases with different attributes based on their temporal and spatial correspondence with visual inputs, and modify their features in a fine-grained manner. Moreover, we introduce a Visual-Language token that comprises modified linguistic information from the previous frame to guide the model to extract visual features that are more relevant to language description, thereby reducing the impact caused by the differences in spatial scale. Experimental results show that our proposed ATSTrack achieves performance comparable to existing methods. Our code will be released.
2507.00868v2	Is Visual in-Context Learning for Compositional Medical Tasks within Reach? . In this paper, we explore the potential of visual in-context learning to enable a single model to handle multiple tasks and adapt to new tasks during test time without re-training. Unlike previous approaches, our focus is on training in-context learners to adapt to sequences of tasks, rather than individual tasks. Our goal is to solve complex tasks that involve multiple intermediate steps using a single model, allowing users to define entire vision pipelines flexibly at test time. To achieve this, we first examine the properties and limitations of visual in-context learning architectures, with a particular focus on the role of codebooks. We then introduce a novel method for training in-context learners using a synthetic compositional task generation engine. This engine bootstraps task sequences from arbitrary segmentation datasets, enabling the training of visual in-context learners for compositional tasks. Additionally, we investigate different masking-based training objectives to gather insights into how to train models better for solving complex, compositional tasks. Our exploration not only provides important insights especially for multi-modal medical task sequences but also highlights challenges that need to be addressed.
2507.00964v1	Benchmarking the Discovery Engine . The Discovery Engine is a general purpose automated system for scientific discovery, which combines machine learning with state-of-the-art ML interpretability to enable rapid and robust scientific insight across diverse datasets. In this paper, we benchmark the Discovery Engine against five recent peer-reviewed scientific publications applying machine learning across medicine, materials science, social science, and environmental science. In each case, the Discovery Engine matches or exceeds prior predictive performance while also generating deeper, more actionable insights through rich interpretability artefacts. These results demonstrate its potential as a new standard for automated, interpretable scientific modelling that enables complex knowledge discovery from data.
2507.01204v1	LotteryCodec: Searching the Implicit Representation in a Random Network for Low-Complexity Image Compression . We introduce and validate the lottery codec hypothesis, which states that untrained subnetworks within randomly initialized networks can serve as synthesis networks for overfitted image compression, achieving rate-distortion (RD) performance comparable to trained networks. This hypothesis leads to a new paradigm for image compression by encoding image statistics into the network substructure. Building on this hypothesis, we propose LotteryCodec, which overfits a binary mask to an individual image, leveraging an over-parameterized and randomly initialized network shared by the encoder and the decoder. To address over-parameterization challenges and streamline subnetwork search, we develop a rewind modulation mechanism that improves the RD performance. LotteryCodec outperforms VTM and sets a new state-of-the-art in single-image compression. LotteryCodec also enables adaptive decoding complexity through adjustable mask ratios, offering flexible compression solutions for diverse device constraints and application requirements.
2507.02279v1	LaCo: Efficient Layer-wise Compression of Visual Tokens for Multimodal Large Language Models . Existing visual token compression methods for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) predominantly operate as post-encoder modules, limiting their potential for efficiency gains. To address this limitation, we propose LaCo (Layer-wise Visual Token Compression), a novel framework that enables effective token compression within the intermediate layers of the vision encoder. LaCo introduces two core components: 1) a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism that systematically merges adjacent tokens through space-to-channel transformations, and 2) a residual learning architecture with non-parametric shortcuts that preserves critical visual information during compression. Extensive experiments indicate that our LaCo outperforms all existing methods when compressing tokens in the intermediate layers of the vision encoder, demonstrating superior effectiveness. In addition, compared to external compression, our method improves training efficiency beyond 20% and inference throughput over 15% while maintaining strong performance.
2507.02957v1	CS-VLM: Compressed Sensing Attention for Efficient Vision-Language Representation Learning . Vision-Language Models (vLLMs) have emerged as powerful architectures for joint reasoning over visual and textual inputs, enabling breakthroughs in image captioning, cross modal retrieval, and multimodal dialogue. However, as these models scale to longer video sequences and richer language descriptions, the quadratic complexity of the standard attention mechanism presents a fundamental computational bottleneck. This challenge is exacerbated in vLLMs, where attention must be computed not only within modalities but also across them, leading to prohibitive memory and latency costs. In this work, we introduce the Compressed Sensing Attention Transformer (CSAT), a novel architecture that reimagines attention computation through the lens of compressed sensing. By projecting high dimensional key and value representations into a lower-dimensional subspace via random measurement matrices and reconstructing the attention outputs using sparse recovery algorithms, CSAT significantly reduces attention complexity while maintaining semantic fidelity. Applied to vLLMs, CSAT exploits the inherent compressibility of both visual and textual representations especially evident in video, where temporal redundancy is high, and in language, where cross-modal grounding is often sparse. In contrast to LLMs, which must often model entangled symbolic dependencies, vLLMs benefit from structured sparsity in alignment and scene composition, making them particularly well-suited to compressed attention. We provide a formal mathematical treatment of CSAT, demonstrate its integration into vision language pipelines, and validate its performance on standard benchmarks, highlighting its promise as a scalable, interpretable, and resource efficient solution for next generation multimodal transformers.
2507.03329v1	NDAI-NeuroMAP: A Neuroscience-Specific Embedding Model for Domain-Specific Retrieval . We present NDAI-NeuroMAP, the first neuroscience-domain-specific dense vector embedding model engineered for high-precision information retrieval tasks. Our methodology encompasses the curation of an extensive domain-specific training corpus comprising 500,000 carefully constructed triplets (query-positive-negative configurations), augmented with 250,000 neuroscience-specific definitional entries and 250,000 structured knowledge-graph triplets derived from authoritative neurological ontologies. We employ a sophisticated fine-tuning approach utilizing the FremyCompany/BioLORD-2023 foundation model, implementing a multi-objective optimization framework combining contrastive learning with triplet-based metric learning paradigms. Comprehensive evaluation on a held-out test dataset comprising approximately 24,000 neuroscience-specific queries demonstrates substantial performance improvements over state-of-the-art general-purpose and biomedical embedding models. These empirical findings underscore the critical importance of domain-specific embedding architectures for neuroscience-oriented RAG systems and related clinical natural language processing applications.
2507.03479v1	Explainable Information Retrieval in the Audit Domain . Conversational agents such as Microsoft Copilot and Google Gemini assist users with complex search tasks but often generate misleading or fabricated references. This undermines trust, particularly in high-stakes domains such as medicine and finance. Explainable information retrieval (XIR) aims to address this by making search results more transparent and interpretable. While most XIR research is domain-agnostic, this paper focuses on auditing -- a critical yet underexplored area. We argue that XIR systems can support auditors in completing their complex task. We outline key challenges and future research directions to advance XIR in this domain.
2507.03674v1	STRUCTSENSE: A Task-Agnostic Agentic Framework for Structured Information Extraction with Human-In-The-Loop Evaluation and Benchmarking . The ability to extract structured information from unstructured sources-such as free-text documents and scientific literature-is critical for accelerating scientific discovery and knowledge synthesis. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing tasks, including structured information extraction. However, their effectiveness often diminishes in specialized, domain-specific contexts that require nuanced understanding and expert-level domain knowledge. In addition, existing LLM-based approaches frequently exhibit poor transferability across tasks and domains, limiting their scalability and adaptability. To address these challenges, we introduce StructSense, a modular, task-agnostic, open-source framework for structured information extraction built on LLMs. StructSense is guided by domain-specific symbolic knowledge encoded in ontologies, enabling it to navigate complex domain content more effectively. It further incorporates agentic capabilities through self-evaluative judges that form a feedback loop for iterative refinement, and includes human-in-the-loop mechanisms to ensure quality and validation. We demonstrate that StructSense can overcome both the limitations of domain sensitivity and the lack of cross-task generalizability, as shown through its application to diverse neuroscience information extraction tasks.
2507.04414v1	THM@SimpleText 2025 -- Task 1.1: Revisiting Text Simplification based on Complex Terms for Non-Experts . Scientific text is complex as it contains technical terms by definition. Simplifying such text for non-domain experts enhances accessibility of innovation and information. Politicians could be enabled to understand new findings on topics on which they intend to pass a law, or family members of seriously ill patients could read about clinical trials. The SimpleText CLEF Lab focuses on exactly this problem of simplification of scientific text. Task 1.1 of the 2025 edition specifically handles the simplification of complex sentences, so very short texts with little context. To tackle this task we investigate the identification of complex terms in sentences which are rephrased using small Gemini and OpenAI large language models for non-expert readers.
2507.05577v1	Beyond Retrieval: Ensembling Cross-Encoders and GPT Rerankers with LLMs for Biomedical QA . Biomedical semantic question answering rooted in information retrieval can play a crucial role in keeping up to date with vast, rapidly evolving and ever-growing biomedical literature. A robust system can help researchers, healthcare professionals and even layman users access relevant knowledge grounded in evidence. The BioASQ 2025 Task13b Challenge serves as an important benchmark, offering a competitive platform for advancement of this space. This paper presents the methodologies and results from our participation in this challenge where we built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that can answer biomedical questions by retrieving relevant PubMed documents and snippets to generate answers. For the retrieval task, we generated dense embeddings from biomedical articles for initial retrieval, and applied an ensemble of finetuned cross-encoders and large language models (LLMs) for re-ranking to identify top relevant documents. Our solution achieved an MAP@10 of 0.1581, placing 10th on the leaderboard for the retrieval task. For answer generation, we employed few-shot prompting of instruction-tuned LLMs. Our system achieved macro-F1 score of 0.95 for yes/no questions (rank 12), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 0.64 for factoid questions (rank 1), mean-F1 score of 0.63 for list questions (rank 5), and ROUGE-SU4 F1 score of 0.29 for ideal answers (rank 11).
2507.05631v1	OFFSET: Segmentation-based Focus Shift Revision for Composed Image Retrieval . Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) represents a novel retrieval paradigm that is capable of expressing users' intricate retrieval requirements flexibly. It enables the user to give a multimodal query, comprising a reference image and a modification text, and subsequently retrieve the target image. Notwithstanding the considerable advances made by prevailing methodologies, CIR remains in its nascent stages due to two limitations: 1) inhomogeneity between dominant and noisy portions in visual data is ignored, leading to query feature degradation, and 2) the priority of textual data in the image modification process is overlooked, which leads to a visual focus bias. To address these two limitations, this work presents a focus mapping-based feature extractor, which consists of two modules: dominant portion segmentation and dual focus mapping. It is designed to identify significant dominant portions in images and guide the extraction of visual and textual data features, thereby reducing the impact of noise interference. Subsequently, we propose a textually guided focus revision module, which can utilize the modification requirements implied in the text to perform adaptive focus revision on the reference image, thereby enhancing the perception of the modification focus on the composed features. The aforementioned modules collectively constitute the segmentatiOn-based Focus shiFt reviSion nETwork (\mbox{OFFSET}), and comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets substantiate the superiority of our proposed method. The codes and data are available on https://zivchen-ty.github.io/OFFSET.github.io/
2507.05973v1	We Should Evaluate Real-World Impact . The ACL community has very little interest in evaluating the real-world impact of NLP systems. A structured survey of the ACL Anthology shows that perhaps 0.1% of its papers contain such evaluations; furthermore most papers which include impact evaluations present them very sketchily and instead focus on metric evaluations. NLP technology would be more useful and more quickly adopted if we seriously tried to understand and evaluate its real-world impact.
2507.05997v1	DocIE@XLLM25: In-Context Learning for Information Extraction using Fully Synthetic Demonstrations . Large, high-quality annotated corpora remain scarce in document-level entity and relation extraction in zero-shot or few-shot settings. In this paper, we present a fully automatic, LLM-based pipeline for synthetic data generation and in-context learning for document-level entity and relation extraction. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on manually annotated demonstrations or direct zero-shot inference, our method combines synthetic data generation with retrieval-based in-context learning, using a reasoning-optimized language model. This allows us to build a high-quality demonstration database without manual annotation and to dynamically retrieve relevant examples at inference time. Based on our approach we produce a synthetic dataset of over $5k$ Wikipedia abstracts with approximately $59k$ entities and $30k$ relation triples. Finally, we evaluate in-context learning performance on the DocIE shared task, extracting entities and relations from long documents in a zero-shot setting. We find that in-context joint entity and relation extraction at document-level remains a challenging task, even for state-of-the-art large language models.
2507.06139v1	Topic Modeling and Link-Prediction for Material Property Discovery . Link prediction infers missing or future relations between graph nodes, based on connection patterns. Scientific literature networks and knowledge graphs are typically large, sparse, and noisy, and often contain missing links between entities. We present an AI-driven hierarchical link prediction framework that integrates matrix factorization to infer hidden associations and steer discovery in complex material domains. Our method combines Hierarchical Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (HNMFk) and Boolean matrix factorization (BNMFk) with automatic model selection, as well as Logistic matrix factorization (LMF), we use to construct a three-level topic tree from a 46,862-document corpus focused on 73 transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). These materials are studied in a variety of physics fields with many current and potential applications.   An ensemble BNMFk + LMF approach fuses discrete interpretability with probabilistic scoring. The resulting HNMFk clusters map each material onto coherent topics like superconductivity, energy storage, and tribology. Also, missing or weakly connected links are highlight between topics and materials, suggesting novel hypotheses for cross-disciplinary exploration. We validate our method by removing publications about superconductivity in well-known superconductors, and show the model predicts associations with the superconducting TMD clusters. This shows the method finds hidden connections in a graph of material to latent topic associations built from scientific literature, especially useful when examining a diverse corpus of scientific documents covering the same class of phenomena or materials but originating from distinct communities and perspectives. The inferred links generating new hypotheses, produced by our method, are exposed through an interactive Streamlit dashboard, designed for human-in-the-loop scientific discovery.
2507.06223v1	Efficiency-Effectiveness Reranking FLOPs for LLM-based Rerankers . Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been applied to reranking tasks in information retrieval, achieving strong performance. However, their high computational demands often hinder practical deployment. Existing studies evaluate the efficiency of LLM-based rerankers using proxy metrics such as latency, the number of forward passes, input tokens, and output tokens. However, these metrics depend on hardware and running-time choices (\eg parallel or not, batch size, etc), and often fail to account for model size, making it difficult to interpret and obscuring the evaluation of the efficiency-effectiveness tradeoff. To address this issue, we propose E\textsuperscript{2}R-FLOPs, for LLM-based rerankers: ranking metrics per PetaFLOP (RPP) for relevance per compute and queries per PetaFLOP (QPP) for hardware-agnostic throughput. Companied with the new metrics, an interpretable FLOPs estimator is built to estimate the FLOPs of an LLM-based reranker even without running any experiments. Based on the proposed metrics, we conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate a wide range of LLM-based rerankers with different architecture, studying the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off and bringing this issue to the attention of the research community.
2507.06460v1	Ragged Blocks: Rendering Structured Text with Style . Whether it be source code in a programming language, prose in natural language, or otherwise, text is highly structured. Currently, text visualizations are confined either to _flat, line-based_ decorations, which can convey only limited information about textual structure, or _nested boxes_, which convey structure but often destroy the typographic layout of the underlying text. We hypothesize that the lack of rich styling options limits the kinds of information that are displayed alongside text, wherever it may be displayed.   In this paper, we show that it is possible to achieve arbitrarily nested decorations while minimally disturbing the underlying typographic layout. Specifically, we present a layout algorithm that generates _ragged blocks_, or _rocks_, which are rectilinear polygons that allow nested text to be compactly rendered even when styled with borders and padding.   We evaluate our layout algorithm in two ways. First, on a benchmark suite comprising representative source code files in multiple programming languages, we show that the (ragged block) layouts produced by our algorithm are substantially more compact than the (rectangular block) layouts produced by conventional techniques, when uniformly styling every element in the syntax tree with borders and padding. Second, through a small gallery of usage scenarios, we demonstrate how future code editors, word processors, and other document-rendering GUIs might convey rich semantic information through domain-specific styling of ragged blocks.
2507.06515v2	QUEST: Query Optimization in Unstructured Document Analysis . Most recently, researchers have started building large language models (LLMs) powered data systems that allow users to analyze unstructured text documents like working with a database because LLMs are very effective in extracting attributes from documents. In such systems, LLM-based extraction operations constitute the performance bottleneck of query execution due to the high monetary cost and slow LLM inference. Existing systems typically borrow the query optimization principles popular in relational databases to produce query execution plans, which unfortunately are ineffective in minimizing LLM cost. To fill this gap, we propose QUEST, which features a bunch of novel optimization strategies for unstructured document analysis. First, we introduce an index-based strategy to minimize the cost of each extraction operation. With this index, QUEST quickly retrieves the text segments relevant to the target attributes and only feeds them to LLMs. Furthermore, we design an evidence-augmented retrieval strategy to reduce the possibility of missing relevant segments. Moreover, we develop an instance-optimized query execution strategy: because the attribute extraction cost could vary significantly document by document, QUEST produces different plans for different documents. For each document, QUEST produces a plan to minimize the frequency of attribute extraction. The innovations include LLM cost-aware operator ordering strategies and an optimized join execution approach that transforms joins into filters. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of QUEST, achieving 30%-6x cost savings while improving the F1 score by 10% -27% compared with state-of-the-art baselines.
2507.06563v1	DS@GT at CheckThat! 2025: Exploring Retrieval and Reranking Pipelines for Scientific Claim Source Retrieval on Social Media Discourse . Social media users often make scientific claims without citing where these claims come from, generating a need to verify these claims.

2507.07106v1	Towards Multimodal Understanding via Stable Diffusion as a Task-Aware Feature Extractor . Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled image-based question-answering capabilities. However, a key limitation is the use of CLIP as the visual encoder; while it can capture coarse global information, it often can miss fine-grained details that are relevant to the input query. To address these shortcomings, this work studies whether pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models can serve as instruction-aware visual encoders. Through an analysis of their internal representations, we find diffusion features are both rich in semantics and can encode strong image-text alignment. Moreover, we find that we can leverage text conditioning to focus the model on regions relevant to the input question. We then investigate how to align these features with large language models and uncover a leakage phenomenon, where the LLM can inadvertently recover information from the original diffusion prompt. We analyze the causes of this leakage and propose a mitigation strategy. Based on these insights, we explore a simple fusion strategy that utilizes both CLIP and conditional diffusion features. We evaluate our approach on both general VQA and specialized MLLM benchmarks, demonstrating the promise of diffusion models for visual understanding, particularly in vision-centric tasks that require spatial and compositional reasoning.

2507.07499v1	Extracting ORR Catalyst Information for Fuel Cell from Scientific Literature . The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalyst plays a critical role in enhancing fuel cell efficiency, making it a key focus in material science research. However, extracting structured information about ORR catalysts from vast scientific literature remains a significant challenge due to the complexity and diversity of textual data. In this study, we propose a named entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) approach using DyGIE++ with multiple pre-trained BERT variants, including MatSciBERT and PubMedBERT, to extract ORR catalyst-related information from the scientific literature, which is compiled into a fuel cell corpus for materials informatics (FC-CoMIcs). A comprehensive dataset was constructed manually by identifying 12 critical entities and two relationship types between pairs of the entities. Our methodology involves data annotation, integration, and fine-tuning of transformer-based models to enhance information extraction accuracy. We assess the impact of different BERT variants on extraction performance and investigate the effects of annotation consistency. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the fine-tuned PubMedBERT model achieves the highest NER F1-score of 82.19% and the MatSciBERT model attains the best RE F1-score of 66.10%. Furthermore, the comparison with human annotators highlights the reliability of fine-tuned models for ORR catalyst extraction, demonstrating their potential for scalable and automated literature analysis. The results indicate that domain-specific BERT models outperform general scientific models like BlueBERT for ORR catalyst extraction.
2507.08191v1	Overview of the TREC 2021 deep learning track . This is the third year of the TREC Deep Learning track. As in previous years, we leverage the MS MARCO datasets that made hundreds of thousands of human annotated training labels available for both passage and document ranking tasks. In addition, this year we refreshed both the document and the passage collections which also led to a nearly four times increase in the document collection size and nearly $16$ times increase in the size of the passage collection. Deep neural ranking models that employ large scale pretraininig continued to outperform traditional retrieval methods this year. We also found that single stage retrieval can achieve good performance on both tasks although they still do not perform at par with multistage retrieval pipelines. Finally, the increase in the collection size and the general data refresh raised some questions about completeness of NIST judgments and the quality of the training labels that were mapped to the new collections from the old ones which we discuss in this report.
2507.08322v2	Towards Efficient Quantity Retrieval from Text:An Approach via Description Parsing and Weak Supervision . Quantitative facts are continually generated by companies and governments, supporting data-driven decision-making. While common facts are structured, many long-tail quantitative facts remain buried in unstructured documents, making them difficult to access. We propose the task of Quantity Retrieval: given a description of a quantitative fact, the system returns the relevant value and supporting evidence. Understanding quantity semantics in context is essential for this task. We introduce a framework based on description parsing that converts text into structured (description, quantity) pairs for effective retrieval. To improve learning, we construct a large paraphrase dataset using weak supervision based on quantity co-occurrence. We evaluate our approach on a large corpus of financial annual reports and a newly annotated quantity description dataset. Our method significantly improves top-1 retrieval accuracy from 30.98 percent to 64.66 percent.
2507.08710v1	L-CLIPScore: a Lightweight Embedding-based Captioning Metric for Evaluating and Training . We propose a novel embedding-based captioning metric termed as L-CLIPScore that can be used for efficiently evaluating caption quality and training captioning model. L-CLIPScore is calculated from a lightweight CLIP (L-CLIP), which is a dual-encoder architecture compressed and distilled from CLIP. To compress, we apply two powerful techniques which are weight multiplexing and matrix decomposition for reducing the parameters of encoders and word embedding matrix, respectively. To distill, we design a novel multi-modal Similarity Regulator (SR) loss to transfer more vision-language alignment knowledge. Specifically, SR loss amplifies the multi-modal embedding similarity if the given image-text pair is matched and diminishes the similarity if the pair is non-matched. By compressing and distilling by this novel SR loss, our L-CLIP achieves comparable multi-modal alignment ability to the original CLIP while it requires fewer computation resources and running time. We carry out exhaustive experiments to validate the efficiency and effectiveness of L-CLIPScore when using it as the judge to evaluate caption quality. We also discover that when using L-CLIPScore as the supervisor to train the captioning model, it should be mixed up by an n-gram-based metric and meanwhile analyze why using L-CLIPScore only will cause fail training.
2507.08890v1	Overview of the TREC 2023 deep learning track . This is the fifth year of the TREC Deep Learning track. As in previous years, we leverage the MS MARCO datasets that made hundreds of thousands of human-annotated training labels available for both passage and document ranking tasks. We mostly repeated last year's design, to get another matching test set, based on the larger, cleaner, less-biased v2 passage and document set, with passage ranking as primary and document ranking as a secondary task (using labels inferred from passage). As we did last year, we sample from MS MARCO queries that were completely held out, unused in corpus construction, unlike the test queries in the first three years. This approach yields a more difficult test with more headroom for improvement. Alongside the usual MS MARCO (human) queries from MS MARCO, this year we generated synthetic queries using a fine-tuned T5 model and using a GPT-4 prompt.   The new headline result this year is that runs using Large Language Model (LLM) prompting in some way outperformed runs that use the "nnlm" approach, which was the best approach in the previous four years. Since this is the last year of the track, future iterations of prompt-based ranking can happen in other tracks. Human relevance assessments were applied to all query types, not just human MS MARCO queries. Evaluation using synthetic queries gave similar results to human queries, with system ordering agreement of $\tau=0.8487$. However, human effort was needed to select a subset of the synthetic queries that were usable. We did not see clear evidence of bias, where runs using GPT-4 were favored when evaluated using synthetic GPT-4 queries, or where runs using T5 were favored when evaluated on synthetic T5 queries.
2507.09428v1	On Information Geometry and Iterative Optimization in Model Compression: Operator Factorization . The ever-increasing parameter counts of deep learning models necessitate effective compression techniques for deployment on resource-constrained devices. This paper explores the application of information geometry, the study of density-induced metrics on parameter spaces, to analyze existing methods within the space of model compression, primarily focusing on operator factorization. Adopting this perspective highlights the core challenge: defining an optimal low-compute submanifold (or subset) and projecting onto it. We argue that many successful model compression approaches can be understood as implicitly approximating information divergences for this projection. We highlight that when compressing a pre-trained model, using information divergences is paramount for achieving improved zero-shot accuracy, yet this may no longer be the case when the model is fine-tuned. In such scenarios, trainability of bottlenecked models turns out to be far more important for achieving high compression ratios with minimal performance degradation, necessitating adoption of iterative methods. In this context, we prove convergence of iterative singular value thresholding for training neural networks subject to a soft rank constraint. To further illustrate the utility of this perspective, we showcase how simple modifications to existing methods through softer rank reduction result in improved performance under fixed compression rates.
2507.09702v1	Token Compression Meets Compact Vision Transformers: A Survey and Comparative Evaluation for Edge AI . Token compression techniques have recently emerged as powerful tools for accelerating Vision Transformer (ViT) inference in computer vision. Due to the quadratic computational complexity with respect to the token sequence length, these methods aim to remove less informative tokens before the attention layers to improve inference throughput. While numerous studies have explored various accuracy-efficiency trade-offs on large-scale ViTs, two critical gaps remain. First, there is a lack of unified survey that systematically categorizes and compares token compression approaches based on their core strategies (e.g., pruning, merging, or hybrid) and deployment settings (e.g., fine-tuning vs. plug-in). Second, most benchmarks are limited to standard ViT models (e.g., ViT-B, ViT-L), leaving open the question of whether such methods remain effective when applied to structurally compressed transformers, which are increasingly deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these gaps, we present the first systematic taxonomy and comparative study of token compression methods, and we evaluate representative techniques on both standard and compact ViT architectures. Our experiments reveal that while token compression methods are effective for general-purpose ViTs, they often underperform when directly applied to compact designs. These findings not only provide practical insights but also pave the way for future research on adapting token optimization techniques to compact transformer-based networks for edge AI and AI agent applications.
2507.10057v1	PRISM: Fine-Grained Paper-to-Paper Retrieval with Multi-Aspect-Aware Query Optimization . Scientific paper retrieval, particularly framed as document-to-document retrieval, aims to identify relevant papers in response to a long-form query paper, rather than a short query string. Previous approaches to this task have focused on abstracts, embedding them into dense vectors as surrogates for full documents and calculating similarity across them, although abstracts provide only sparse and high-level summaries. To address this, we propose PRISM, a novel document-to-document retrieval method that introduces multiple, fine-grained representations for both the query and candidate papers. In particular, each query paper is decomposed into multiple aspect-specific views and individually embedded, which are then matched against candidate papers similarity segmented to consider their multifaceted dimensions. Moreover, we present SciFullBench, a novel benchmark in which the complete and segmented context of full papers for both queries and candidates is available. Then, experimental results show that PRISM improves performance by an average of 4.3% over existing retrieval baselines.
2507.10059v1	GeLaCo: An Evolutionary Approach to Layer Compression . Large Language Models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance across a large number of tasks, but face critical deployment and usage barriers due to substantial computational requirements. Model compression methods, which aim to reduce model size while preserving its capacity, are an important means to mitigate these issues. Promising approaches along these lines, such as structured pruning, typically require costly empirical search for optimal variants and may run the risk of ignoring better solutions. In this work we introduce GeLaCo, an evolutionary approach to LLM compression via layer collapse. Our approach supports an efficient exploration of the compression solution space via population-based search and a module-wise similarity fitness function capturing attention, feed-forward, and hidden state representations. GeLaCo also supports both single and multi-objective evolutionary compression search, establishing the first Pareto frontier along compression and quality axes. We evaluate GeLaCo solutions via both perplexity-based and generative evaluations over foundational and instruction-tuned models, outperforming state-of-the-art alternatives.
2507.10442v1	Response Wide Shut? Surprising Observations in Basic Vision Language Model Capabilities . Vision-language Models (VLMs) have emerged as general-purpose tools for addressing a variety of complex computer vision problems. Such models have been shown to be highly capable, but, at the same time, lacking some basic visual understanding skills. In this paper, we set out to understand the limitations of SoTA VLMs on fundamental visual tasks by constructing a series of tests that probe which components of design, specifically, may be lacking. Importantly, we go significantly beyond the current benchmarks, which simply measure the final performance of VLM response, by also comparing and contrasting it to the performance of probes trained directly on features obtained from the visual encoder, intermediate vision-language projection and LLM-decoder output. In doing so, we uncover shortcomings in VLMs and make a number of important observations about their capabilities, robustness and how they process visual information. We hope our insights will guide progress in further improving VLMs.
2507.10726v1	Extracting Document Relations from Search Corpus by Marginalizing over User Queries . Understanding relationships between documents in large-scale corpora is essential for knowledge discovery and information organization. However, existing approaches rely heavily on manual annotation or predefined relationship taxonomies. We propose EDR-MQ (Extracting Document Relations by Marginalizing over User Queries), a novel framework that discovers document relationships through query marginalization. EDR-MQ is based on the insight that strongly related documents often co-occur in results across diverse user queries, enabling us to estimate joint probabilities between document pairs by marginalizing over a collection of queries. To enable this query marginalization approach, we develop Multiply Conditioned Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MC-RAG), which employs conditional retrieval where subsequent document retrievals depend on previously retrieved content. By observing co-occurrence patterns across diverse queries, EDR-MQ estimates joint probabilities between document pairs without requiring labeled training data or predefined taxonomies. Experimental results show that our query marginalization approach successfully identifies meaningful document relationships, revealing topical clusters, evidence chains, and cross-domain connections that are not apparent through traditional similarity-based methods. Our query-driven framework offers a practical approach to document organization that adapts to different user perspectives and information needs.
2507.10865v1	Overview of the TREC 2022 deep learning track . This is the fourth year of the TREC Deep Learning track. As in previous years, we leverage the MS MARCO datasets that made hundreds of thousands of human annotated training labels available for both passage and document ranking tasks. In addition, this year we also leverage both the refreshed passage and document collections that were released last year leading to a nearly $16$ times increase in the size of the passage collection and nearly four times increase in the document collection size. Unlike previous years, in 2022 we mainly focused on constructing a more complete test collection for the passage retrieval task, which has been the primary focus of the track. The document ranking task was kept as a secondary task, where document-level labels were inferred from the passage-level labels. Our analysis shows that similar to previous years, deep neural ranking models that employ large scale pretraining continued to outperform traditional retrieval methods. Due to the focusing our judging resources on passage judging, we are more confident in the quality of this year's queries and judgments, with respect to our ability to distinguish between runs and reuse the dataset in future. We also see some surprises in overall outcomes. Some top-performing runs did not do dense retrieval. Runs that did single-stage dense retrieval were not as competitive this year as they were last year.
2507.11730v1	Seeing the Signs: A Survey of Edge-Deployable OCR Models for Billboard Visibility Analysis . Outdoor advertisements remain a critical medium for modern marketing, yet accurately verifying billboard text visibility under real-world conditions is still challenging. Traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipelines excel at cropped text recognition but often struggle with complex outdoor scenes, varying fonts, and weather-induced visual noise. Recently, multimodal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising alternatives, offering end-to-end scene understanding with no explicit detection step. This work systematically benchmarks representative VLMs - including Qwen 2.5 VL 3B, InternVL3, and SmolVLM2 - against a compact CNN-based OCR baseline (PaddleOCRv4) across two public datasets (ICDAR 2015 and SVT), augmented with synthetic weather distortions to simulate realistic degradation. Our results reveal that while selected VLMs excel at holistic scene reasoning, lightweight CNN pipelines still achieve competitive accuracy for cropped text at a fraction of the computational cost-an important consideration for edge deployment. To foster future research, we release our weather-augmented benchmark and evaluation code publicly.
2507.11972v1	Graph Representations for Reading Comprehension Analysis using Large Language Model and Eye-Tracking Biomarker . Reading comprehension is a fundamental skill in human cognitive development. With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing need to compare how humans and LLMs understand language across different contexts and apply this understanding to functional tasks such as inference, emotion interpretation, and information retrieval. Our previous work used LLMs and human biomarkers to study the reading comprehension process. The results showed that the biomarkers corresponding to words with high and low relevance to the inference target, as labeled by the LLMs, exhibited distinct patterns, particularly when validated using eye-tracking data. However, focusing solely on individual words limited the depth of understanding, which made the conclusions somewhat simplistic despite their potential significance. This study used an LLM-based AI agent to group words from a reading passage into nodes and edges, forming a graph-based text representation based on semantic meaning and question-oriented prompts. We then compare the distribution of eye fixations on important nodes and edges. Our findings indicate that LLMs exhibit high consistency in language understanding at the level of graph topological structure. These results build on our previous findings and offer insights into effective human-AI co-learning strategies.
2507.12334v1	An Analysis of Text Functions in Information Visualization . Text is an integral but understudied component of visualization design. Although recent studies have examined how text elements (e.g., titles and annotations) influence comprehension, preferences, and predictions, many questions remain about textual design and use in practice. This paper introduces a framework for understanding text functions in information visualizations, building on and filling gaps in prior classifications and taxonomies. Through an analysis of 120 real-world visualizations and 804 text elements, we identified ten distinct text functions, ranging from identifying data mappings to presenting valenced subtext. We further identify patterns in text usage and conduct a factor analysis, revealing four overarching text-informed design strategies: Attribution and Variables, Annotation-Centric Design, Visual Embellishments, and Narrative Framing. In addition to these factors, we explore features of title rhetoric and text multifunctionality, while also uncovering previously unexamined text functions, such as text replacing visual elements. Our findings highlight the flexibility of text, demonstrating how different text elements in a given design can combine to communicate, synthesize, and frame visual information. This framework adds important nuance and detail to existing frameworks that analyze the diverse roles of text in visualization.
2507.12441v1	Describe Anything Model for Visual Question Answering on Text-rich Images . Recent progress has been made in region-aware vision-language modeling, particularly with the emergence of the Describe Anything Model (DAM). DAM is capable of generating detailed descriptions of any specific image areas or objects without the need for additional localized image-text alignment supervision. We hypothesize that such region-level descriptive capability is beneficial for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA), especially in challenging scenarios involving images with dense text. In such settings, the fine-grained extraction of textual information is crucial to producing correct answers. Motivated by this, we introduce DAM-QA, a framework with a tailored evaluation protocol, developed to investigate and harness the region-aware capabilities from DAM for the text-rich VQA problem that requires reasoning over text-based information within images. DAM-QA incorporates a mechanism that aggregates answers from multiple regional views of image content, enabling more effective identification of evidence that may be tied to text-related elements. Experiments on six VQA benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms the baseline DAM, with a notable 7+ point gain on DocVQA. DAM-QA also achieves the best overall performance among region-aware models with fewer parameters, significantly narrowing the gap with strong generalist VLMs. These results highlight the potential of DAM-like models for text-rich and broader VQA tasks when paired with efficient usage and integration strategies. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Linvyl/DAM-QA.git.
2507.12466v1	Language Models Improve When Pretraining Data Matches Target Tasks . Every data selection method inherently has a target. In practice, these targets often emerge implicitly through benchmark-driven iteration: researchers develop selection strategies, train models, measure benchmark performance, then refine accordingly. This raises a natural question: what happens when we make this optimization explicit? To explore this, we propose benchmark-targeted ranking (BETR), a simple method that selects pretraining documents based on similarity to benchmark training examples. BETR embeds benchmark examples and a sample of pretraining documents in a shared space, scores this sample by similarity to benchmarks, then trains a lightweight classifier to predict these scores for the full corpus. We compare data selection methods by training over 500 models spanning $10^{19}$ to $10^{22}$ FLOPs and fitting scaling laws to them. From this, we find that simply aligning pretraining data to evaluation benchmarks using BETR achieves a 2.1x compute multiplier over DCLM-Baseline (4.7x over unfiltered data) and improves performance on 9 out of 10 tasks across all scales. BETR also generalizes well: when targeting a diverse set of benchmarks disjoint from our evaluation suite, it still matches or outperforms baselines. Our scaling analysis further reveals a clear trend: larger models require less aggressive filtering. Overall, our findings show that directly matching pretraining data to target tasks precisely shapes model capabilities and highlight that optimal selection strategies must adapt to model scale.
2507.12566v1	Mono-InternVL-1.5: Towards Cheaper and Faster Monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models . This paper focuses on monolithic Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrate visual encoding and language decoding into a single model. Existing structures and pre-training strategies for monolithic MLLMs often suffer from unstable optimization and catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, our key idea is to embed a new visual parameter space into a pre-trained LLM, enabling stable learning of visual knowledge from noisy data via delta tuning. Based on this principle, we first introduce Mono-InternVL, an advanced monolithic MLLM that incorporates a set of visual experts through a multimodal mixture-of-experts architecture. In addition, we design an innovative Endogenous Visual Pre-training (EViP) for Mono-InternVL to maximize its visual capabilities via progressive learning. Mono-InternVL achieves competitive performance against existing MLLMs but also leads to relatively expensive data cost. Therefore, we further present Mono-InternVL-1.5, a cheaper and stronger monolithic MLLM equipped with an improved EViP (EViP++). EViP++ introduces additional visual attention experts to Mono-InternVL-1.5 and re-organizes the pre-training process in an efficient manner. During inference, it includes a fused CUDA kernel to speed up its MoE operations. With these designs, Mono-InternVL-1.5 significantly reduces training and inference costs, while still maintaining competitive performance with Mono-InternVL. To evaluate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments across 15 benchmarks. Results demonstrate that Mono-InternVL outperforms existing monolithic MLLMs on 12 out of 15 benchmarks, e.g., +114-point improvement over Emu3 on OCRBench. Compared to its modular counterpart, i.e., InternVL-1.5, Mono-InternVL-1.5 achieves similar multimodal performance while reducing first-token latency by up to 69%. Code and models are released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/Mono-InternVL.
2507.13105v1	SemCSE: Semantic Contrastive Sentence Embeddings Using LLM-Generated Summaries For Scientific Abstracts . We introduce SemCSE, an unsupervised method for learning semantic embeddings of scientific texts. Building on recent advances in contrastive learning for text embeddings, our approach leverages LLM-generated summaries of scientific abstracts to train a model that positions semantically related summaries closer together in the embedding space. This resulting objective ensures that the model captures the true semantic content of a text, in contrast to traditional citation-based approaches that do not necessarily reflect semantic similarity. To validate this, we propose a novel benchmark designed to assess a model's ability to understand and encode the semantic content of scientific texts, demonstrating that our method enforces a stronger semantic separation within the embedding space. Additionally, we evaluate SemCSE on the comprehensive SciRepEval benchmark for scientific text embeddings, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of its size, thus highlighting the benefits of a semantically focused training approach.
2507.13348v1	VisionThink: Smart and Efficient Vision Language Model via Reinforcement Learning . Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have improved performance by increasing the number of visual tokens, which are often significantly longer than text tokens. However, we observe that most real-world scenarios do not require such an extensive number of visual tokens. While the performance drops significantly in a small subset of OCR-related tasks, models still perform accurately in most other general VQA tasks with only 1/4 resolution. Therefore, we propose to dynamically process distinct samples with different resolutions, and present a new paradigm for visual token compression, namely, VisionThink. It starts with a downsampled image and smartly decides whether it is sufficient for problem solving. Otherwise, the model could output a special token to request the higher-resolution image. Compared to existing Efficient VLM methods that compress tokens using fixed pruning ratios or thresholds, VisionThink autonomously decides whether to compress tokens case by case. As a result, it demonstrates strong fine-grained visual understanding capability on OCR-related tasks, and meanwhile saves substantial visual tokens on simpler tasks. We adopt reinforcement learning and propose the LLM-as-Judge strategy to successfully apply RL to general VQA tasks. Moreover, we carefully design a reward function and penalty mechanism to achieve a stable and reasonable image resize call ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority, efficiency, and effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/VisionThink.
2507.13910v1	PARK: Personalized academic retrieval with knowledge-graphs . Academic Search is a search task aimed to manage and retrieve scientific documents like journal articles and conference papers. Personalization in this context meets individual researchers' needs by leveraging, through user profiles, the user related information (e.g. documents authored by a researcher), to improve search effectiveness and to reduce the information overload. While citation graphs are a valuable means to support the outcome of recommender systems, their use in personalized academic search (with, e.g. nodes as papers and edges as citations) is still under-explored.   Existing personalized models for academic search often struggle to fully capture users' academic interests. To address this, we propose a two-step approach: first, training a neural language model for retrieval, then converting the academic graph into a knowledge graph and embedding it into a shared semantic space with the language model using translational embedding techniques. This allows user models to capture both explicit relationships and hidden structures in citation graphs and paper content. We evaluate our approach in four academic search domains, outperforming traditional graph-based and personalized models in three out of four, with up to a 10\% improvement in MAP@100 over the second-best model. This highlights the potential of knowledge graph-based user models to enhance retrieval effectiveness.
2507.14096v2	Lessons from the TREC Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts (PLABA) track . Objective: Recent advances in language models have shown potential to adapt professional-facing biomedical literature to plain language, making it accessible to patients and caregivers. However, their unpredictability, combined with the high potential for harm in this domain, means rigorous evaluation is necessary. Our goals with this track were to stimulate research and to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.   Methods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts (PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included complete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as identifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of Task 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references. Submissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation from biomedical experts.   Results: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track, with models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In manual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of factual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic, reference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments. In Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying how to replace them. When generating replacements, however, LLM-based systems did well in manually judged accuracy, completeness, and simplicity, though not in brevity.   Conclusion: The PLABA track showed promise for using Large Language Models to adapt biomedical literature for the general public, while also highlighting their deficiencies and the need for improved automatic benchmarking tools.
2507.14497v1	Efficient Whole Slide Pathology VQA via Token Compression . Whole-slide images (WSIs) in pathology can reach up to 10,000 x 10,000 pixels, posing significant challenges for multimodal large language model (MLLM) due to long context length and high computational demands. Previous methods typically focus on patch-level analysis or slide-level classification using CLIP-based models with multi-instance learning, but they lack the generative capabilities needed for visual question answering (VQA). More recent MLLM-based approaches address VQA by feeding thousands of patch tokens directly into the language model, which leads to excessive resource consumption. To address these limitations, we propose Token Compression Pathology LLaVA (TCP-LLaVA), the first MLLM architecture to perform WSI VQA via token compression. TCP-LLaVA introduces a set of trainable compression tokens that aggregate visual and textual information through a modality compression module, inspired by the [CLS] token mechanism in BERT. Only the compressed tokens are forwarded to the LLM for answer generation, significantly reducing input length and computational cost. Experiments on ten TCGA tumor subtypes show that TCP-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLM baselines in VQA accuracy while reducing training resource consumption by a substantial margin.
2507.14520v1	What if Othello-Playing Language Models Could See? . Language models are often said to face a symbol grounding problem. While some argue that world understanding can emerge from text alone, others suggest grounded learning is more efficient. We explore this through Othello, where the board state defines a simplified, rule-based world. Building on prior work, we introduce VISOTHELLO, a multi-modal model trained on move histories and board images. Using next-move prediction, we compare it to mono-modal baselines and test robustness to semantically irrelevant perturbations. We find that multi-modal training improves both performance and the robustness of internal representations. These results suggest that grounding language in visual input helps models infer structured world representations.
2507.14604v1	Understanding Matching Mechanisms in Cross-Encoders . Neural IR architectures, particularly cross-encoders, are highly effective models whose internal mechanisms are mostly unknown. Most works trying to explain their behavior focused on high-level processes (e.g., what in the input influences the prediction, does the model adhere to known IR axioms) but fall short of describing the matching process. Instead of Mechanistic Interpretability approaches which specifically aim at explaining the hidden mechanisms of neural models, we demonstrate that more straightforward methods can already provide valuable insights. In this paper, we first focus on the attention process and extract causal insights highlighting the crucial roles of some attention heads in this process. Second, we provide an interpretation of the mechanism underlying matching detection.
2507.14769v1	Task Mode: Dynamic Filtering for Task-Specific Web Navigation using LLMs . Modern web interfaces are unnecessarily complex to use as they overwhelm users with excessive text and visuals unrelated to their current goals. This problem particularly impacts screen reader users (SRUs), who navigate content sequentially and may spend minutes traversing irrelevant elements before reaching desired information compared to vision users (VUs) who visually skim in seconds. We present Task Mode, a system that dynamically filters web content based on user-specified goals using large language models to identify and prioritize relevant elements while minimizing distractions. Our approach preserves page structure while offering multiple viewing modes tailored to different access needs. Our user study with 12 participants (6 VUs, 6 SRUs) demonstrates that our approach reduced task completion time for SRUs while maintaining performance for VUs, decreasing the completion time gap between groups from 2x to 1.2x. 11 of 12 participants wanted to use Task Mode in the future, reporting that Task Mode supported completing tasks with less effort and fewer distractions. This work demonstrates how designing new interactions simultaneously for visual and non-visual access can reduce rather than reinforce accessibility disparities in future technology created by human-computer interaction researchers and practitioners.
2507.14904v1	TriCLIP-3D: A Unified Parameter-Efficient Framework for Tri-Modal 3D Visual Grounding based on CLIP . 3D visual grounding allows an embodied agent to understand visual information in real-world 3D environments based on human instructions, which is crucial for embodied intelligence. Existing 3D visual grounding methods typically rely on separate encoders for different modalities (e.g., RGB images, text, and 3D point clouds), resulting in large and complex models that are inefficient to train. While some approaches use pre-trained 2D multi-modal models like CLIP for 3D tasks, they still struggle with aligning point cloud data to 2D encoders. As a result, these methods continue to depend on 3D encoders for feature extraction, further increasing model complexity and training inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified 2D pre-trained multi-modal network to process all three modalities (RGB images, text, and point clouds), significantly simplifying the architecture. By leveraging a 2D CLIP bi-modal model with adapter-based fine-tuning, this framework effectively adapts to the tri-modal setting, improving both adaptability and performance across modalities. Our Geometric-Aware 2D-3D Feature Recovery and Fusion (GARF) module is designed to fuse geometric multi-scale features from point clouds and images. We then integrate textual features for final modality fusion and introduce a multi-modal decoder to facilitate deep cross-modal understanding. Together, our method achieves unified feature extraction and fusion across the three modalities, enabling an end-to-end 3D visual grounding model. Compared to the baseline, our method reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 58\%, while achieving a 6.52\% improvement in the 3D detection task and a 6.25\% improvement in the 3D visual grounding task.
2507.15269v1	Conditional Video Generation for High-Efficiency Video Compression . Perceptual studies demonstrate that conditional diffusion models excel at reconstructing video content aligned with human visual perception. Building on this insight, we propose a video compression framework that leverages conditional diffusion models for perceptually optimized reconstruction. Specifically, we reframe video compression as a conditional generation task, where a generative model synthesizes video from sparse, yet informative signals. Our approach introduces three key modules: (1) Multi-granular conditioning that captures both static scene structure and dynamic spatio-temporal cues; (2) Compact representations designed for efficient transmission without sacrificing semantic richness; (3) Multi-condition training with modality dropout and role-aware embeddings, which prevent over-reliance on any single modality and enhance robustness. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly outperforms both traditional and neural codecs on perceptual quality metrics such as Fr\'echet Video Distance (FVD) and LPIPS, especially under high compression ratios.
2507.17047v1	Controllable Hybrid Captioner for Improved Long-form Video Understanding . Video data, especially long-form video, is extremely dense and high-dimensional. Text-based summaries of video content offer a way to represent query-relevant content in a much more compact manner than raw video. In addition, textual representations are easily ingested by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), which enable reasoning over video content to answer complex natural language queries. To solve this issue, we rely on the progressive construction of a text-based memory by a video captioner operating on shorter chunks of the video, where spatio-temporal modeling is computationally feasible. We explore ways to improve the quality of the activity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video captions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to other information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene descriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding system relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer questions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the video into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more accurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we incorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA VLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the space of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we have successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action and scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning pipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks. Our model, controllable hybrid captioner, can alternate between different types of captions according to special input tokens that signals scene changes detected in the video.
2508.00367v1	Representation Shift: Unifying Token Compression with FlashAttention . Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success across vision, language, and video. Yet, increasing task complexity has led to larger models and more tokens, raising the quadratic cost of self-attention and the overhead of GPU memory access. To reduce the computation cost of self-attention, prior work has proposed token compression techniques that drop redundant or less informative tokens. Meanwhile, fused attention kernels such as FlashAttention have been developed to alleviate memory overhead by avoiding attention map construction and its associated I/O to HBM. This, however, makes it incompatible with most training-free token compression methods, which rely on attention maps to determine token importance. Here, we propose Representation Shift, a training-free, model-agnostic metric that measures the degree of change in each token's representation. This seamlessly integrates token compression with FlashAttention, without attention maps or retraining. Our method further generalizes beyond Transformers to CNNs and state space models. Extensive experiments show that Representation Shift enables effective token compression compatible with FlashAttention, yielding significant speedups of up to 5.5% and 4.4% in video-text retrieval and video QA, respectively. Code is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/Representation-Shift.
2508.01096v1	Cross-Domain Web Information Extraction at Pinterest . The internet offers a massive repository of unstructured information, but it's a significant challenge to convert this into a structured format. At Pinterest, the ability to accurately extract structured product data from e-commerce websites is essential to enhance user experiences and improve content distribution. In this paper, we present Pinterest's system for attribute extraction, which achieves remarkable accuracy and scalability at a manageable cost. Our approach leverages a novel webpage representation that combines structural, visual, and text modalities into a compact form, optimizing it for small model learning. This representation captures each visible HTML node with its text, style and layout information. We show how this allows simple models such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to extract attributes more accurately than much more complex Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). Our results demonstrate a system that is highly scalable, processing over 1,000 URLs per second, while being 1000 times more cost-effective than the cheapest GPT alternatives.
2508.06038v2	Fourier-VLM: Compressing Vision Tokens in the Frequency Domain for Large Vision-Language Models . Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically replace the predefined image placeholder token (<image>) in textual instructions with visual features from an image encoder, forming the input to a backbone Large Language Model (LLM). However, the large number of vision tokens significantly increases the context length, leading to high computational overhead and inference latency. While previous efforts mitigate this by selecting only important visual features or leveraging learnable queries to reduce token count, they often compromise performance or introduce substantial extra costs. In response, we propose Fourier-VLM, a simple yet efficient method that compresses visual representations in the frequency domain. Our approach is motivated by the observation that vision features output from the vision encoder exhibit concentrated energy in low-frequency components. Leveraging this, we apply a low-pass filter to the vision features using a two-dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Notably, the DCT is efficiently computed via the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operator with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$, minimizing the extra computational cost while introducing no additional parameters. Extensive experiments across various image-based benchmarks demonstrate that Fourier-VLM achieves competitive performance with strong generalizability across both LLaVA and Qwen-VL architectures. Crucially, it reduce inference FLOPs by up to 83.8% and boots generation speed by 31.2% compared to LLaVA-v1.5, highlighting the superior efficiency and practicality.
2508.06600v1	BrowseComp-Plus: A More Fair and Transparent Evaluation Benchmark of Deep-Research Agent . Deep-Research agents, which integrate large language models (LLMs) with search tools, have shown success in improving the effectiveness of handling complex queries that require iterative search planning and reasoning over search results. Evaluations on current benchmarks like BrowseComp relies on black-box live web search APIs, have notable limitations in (1) fairness: dynamic and opaque web APIs hinder fair comparisons and reproducibility of deep research methods; (2) transparency: lack of control over the document corpus makes it difficult to isolate retriever contributions. In other words, the current evaluations may compare a complete deep research system at a given time, but they do not foster well-controlled experiments to provide insights into the capability of underlying deep research LLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce BrowseComp-Plus, a benchmark derived from BrowseComp, employing a fixed, carefully curated corpus. Each query in BrowseComp-Plus includes human-verified supporting documents and mined challenging negatives, enabling controlled experimentation. The benchmark is shown to be effective in distinguishing the performance of deep research systems. For instance, the open-source model Search-R1, when paired with the BM25 retriever, achieves 3.86% accuracy, whereas the GPT-5 achieves 55.9%. Integrating the GPT-5 with the Qwen3-Embedding-8B retriever further enhances its accuracy to 70.1% with fewer search calls. This benchmark allows comprehensive evaluation and disentangled analysis of deep research agents and retrieval methods, fostering insights into retrieval effectiveness, citation accuracy, and context engineering in Deep-Research system.
2508.06696v1	Learning More by Seeing Less: Line Drawing Pretraining for Efficient, Transferable, and Human-Aligned Vision . Despite remarkable progress in computer vision, modern recognition systems remain limited by their dependence on rich, redundant visual inputs. In contrast, humans can effortlessly understand sparse, minimal representations like line drawings - suggesting that structure, rather than appearance, underlies efficient visual understanding. In this work, we propose using line drawings as a structure-first pretraining modality to induce more compact and generalizable visual representations. We show that models pretrained on line drawings develop stronger shape bias, more focused attention, and greater data efficiency across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. Notably, these models also exhibit lower intrinsic dimensionality, requiring significantly fewer principal components to capture representational variance - echoing the similar observation in low dimensional efficient representation in the brain. Beyond performance improvements, line drawing pretraining produces more compressible representations, enabling better distillation into lightweight student models. Students distilled from line-pretrained teachers consistently outperform those trained from color-supervised teachers, highlighting the benefits of structurally compact knowledge. Finally, we demonstrate that the pretraining with line-drawing can also be extended to unsupervised setting via our proposed method "learning to draw". Together, our results support the view that structure-first visual learning fosters efficiency, generalization, and human-aligned inductive biases - offering a simple yet powerful strategy for building more robust and adaptable vision systems.
2508.20033v1	DeepScholar-Bench: A Live Benchmark and Automated Evaluation for Generative Research Synthesis . The ability to research and synthesize knowledge is central to human expertise and progress. An emerging class of systems promises these exciting capabilities through generative research synthesis, performing retrieval over the live web and synthesizing discovered sources into long-form, cited summaries. However, evaluating such systems remains an open challenge: existing question-answering benchmarks focus on short-form factual responses, while expert-curated datasets risk staleness and data contamination. Both fail to capture the complexity and evolving nature of real research synthesis tasks. In this work, we introduce DeepScholar-bench, a live benchmark and holistic, automated evaluation framework designed to evaluate generative research synthesis. DeepScholar-bench draws queries from recent, high-quality ArXiv papers and focuses on a real research synthesis task: generating the related work sections of a paper by retrieving, synthesizing, and citing prior research. Our evaluation framework holistically assesses performance across three key dimensions, knowledge synthesis, retrieval quality, and verifiability. We also develop DeepScholar-base, a reference pipeline implemented efficiently using the LOTUS API. Using the DeepScholar-bench framework, we perform a systematic evaluation of prior open-source systems, search AI's, OpenAI's DeepResearch, and DeepScholar-base. We find that DeepScholar-base establishes a strong baseline, attaining competitive or higher performance than each other method. We also find that DeepScholar-bench remains far from saturated, with no system exceeding a score of $19\%$ across all metrics. These results underscore the difficulty of DeepScholar-bench, as well as its importance for progress towards AI systems capable of generative research synthesis. We make our code available at https://github.com/guestrin-lab/deepscholar-bench.
2509.04011v1	NER Retriever: Zero-Shot Named Entity Retrieval with Type-Aware Embeddings . We present NER Retriever, a zero-shot retrieval framework for ad-hoc Named Entity Retrieval, a variant of Named Entity Recognition (NER), where the types of interest are not provided in advance, and a user-defined type description is used to retrieve documents mentioning entities of that type. Instead of relying on fixed schemas or fine-tuned models, our method builds on internal representations of large language models (LLMs) to embed both entity mentions and user-provided open-ended type descriptions into a shared semantic space. We show that internal representations, specifically the value vectors from mid-layer transformer blocks, encode fine-grained type information more effectively than commonly used top-layer embeddings. To refine these representations, we train a lightweight contrastive projection network that aligns type-compatible entities while separating unrelated types. The resulting entity embeddings are compact, type-aware, and well-suited for nearest-neighbor search. Evaluated on three benchmarks, NER Retriever significantly outperforms both lexical and dense sentence-level retrieval baselines. Our findings provide empirical support for representation selection within LLMs and demonstrate a practical solution for scalable, schema-free entity retrieval. The NER Retriever Codebase is publicly available at https://github.com/ShacharOr100/ner_retriever
2509.04190v1	The changing role of cited papers over time: An analysis of highly cited papers based on a large full-text dataset . This paper examines how the role of cited papers evolves over time by analyzing nearly 900 highly cited papers (HCPs) published between 2000 and 2016 and the full text of over 220,000 papers citing them. We investigate multiple citation characteristics, including citation location within the full text, reference and in-text citation types, citation sentiment, and textual and bibliographic relatedness between citing and cited papers. Our findings reveal that as HCPs age, they tend to be cited earlier in papers citing them, mentioned fewer times in the full text, and more often cited alongside other references. Citation sentiment remains predominantly neutral, while both textual and bibliographic similarity between HCPs and their citing papers decline over time. These patterns indicate a shift from direct topical and methodological engagement toward more general, background, and symbolic referencing. The findings highlight the importance to consider citation context rather than relying solely on simple citation counts. Large-scale full-text analyses such as ours can help refine measures of scientific impact and advance scholarly search and science mapping by uncovering more nuanced connections between papers.
2509.04337v1	Decoupled Entity Representation Learning for Pinterest Ads Ranking . In this paper, we introduce a novel framework following an upstream-downstream paradigm to construct user and item (Pin) embeddings from diverse data sources, which are essential for Pinterest to deliver personalized Pins and ads effectively. Our upstream models are trained on extensive data sources featuring varied signals, utilizing complex architectures to capture intricate relationships between users and Pins on Pinterest. To ensure scalability of the upstream models, entity embeddings are learned, and regularly refreshed, rather than real-time computation, allowing for asynchronous interaction between the upstream and downstream models. These embeddings are then integrated as input features in numerous downstream tasks, including ad retrieval and ranking models for CTR and CVR predictions. We demonstrate that our framework achieves notable performance improvements in both offline and online settings across various downstream tasks. This framework has been deployed in Pinterest's production ad ranking systems, resulting in significant gains in online metrics.
2509.05925v1	Compression Beyond Pixels: Semantic Compression with Multimodal Foundation Models . Recent deep learning-based methods for lossy image compression achieve competitive rate-distortion performance through extensive end-to-end training and advanced architectures. However, emerging applications increasingly prioritize semantic preservation over pixel-level reconstruction and demand robust performance across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks. These challenges call for advanced semantic compression paradigms. Motivated by the zero-shot and representational capabilities of multimodal foundation models, we propose a novel semantic compression method based on the contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) model. Rather than compressing images for reconstruction, we propose compressing the CLIP feature embeddings into minimal bits while preserving semantic information across different tasks. Experiments show that our method maintains semantic integrity across benchmark datasets, achieving an average bit rate of approximately 2-3* 10(-3) bits per pixel. This is less than 5% of the bitrate required by mainstream image compression approaches for comparable performance. Remarkably, even under extreme compression, the proposed approach exhibits zero-shot robustness across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks.
2509.06195v1	Language Bias in Information Retrieval: The Nature of the Beast and Mitigation Methods . Language fairness in multilingual information retrieval (MLIR) systems is crucial for ensuring equitable access to information across diverse languages. This paper sheds light on the issue, based on the assumption that queries in different languages, but with identical semantics, should yield equivalent ranking lists when retrieving on the same multilingual documents. We evaluate the degree of fairness using both traditional retrieval methods, and a DPR neural ranker based on mBERT and XLM-R. Additionally, we introduce `LaKDA', a novel loss designed to mitigate language biases in neural MLIR approaches. Our analysis exposes intrinsic language biases in current MLIR technologies, with notable disparities across the retrieval methods, and the effectiveness of LaKDA in enhancing language fairness.
2509.06412v1	Compare: A Framework for Scientific Comparisons . Navigating the vast and rapidly increasing sea of academic publications to identify institutional synergies, benchmark research contributions and pinpoint key research contributions has become an increasingly daunting task, especially with the current exponential increase in new publications. Existing tools provide useful overviews or single-document insights, but none supports structured, qualitative comparisons across institutions or publications.   To address this, we demonstrate Compare, a novel framework that tackles this challenge by enabling sophisticated long-context comparisons of scientific contributions. Compare empowers users to explore and analyze research overlaps and differences at both the institutional and publication granularity, all driven by user-defined questions and automatic retrieval over online resources. For this we leverage on Retrieval-Augmented Generation over evolving data sources to foster long context knowledge synthesis. Unlike traditional scientometric tools, Compare goes beyond quantitative indicators by providing qualitative, citation-supported comparisons.
2509.06415v1	Index-Preserving Lightweight Token Pruning for Efficient Document Understanding in Vision-Language Models . Recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs) has led to impressive results in document understanding tasks, but their high computational demands remain a challenge. To mitigate the compute burdens, we propose a lightweight token pruning framework that filters out non-informative background regions from document images prior to VLM processing. A binary patch-level classifier removes non-text areas, and a max-pooling refinement step recovers fragmented text regions to enhance spatial coherence. Experiments on real-world document datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially lowers computational costs, while maintaining comparable accuracy.
2509.06917v1	Paper2Agent: Reimagining Research Papers As Interactive and Reliable AI Agents . We introduce Paper2Agent, an automated framework that converts research papers into AI agents. Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive artifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and discovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial effort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own work, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this challenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a knowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the associated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify the resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat agent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through natural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We demonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper agents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that leverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy and TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We validate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and can correctly carry out novel user queries. By turning static papers into dynamic, interactive AI agents, Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for knowledge dissemination and a foundation for the collaborative ecosystem of AI co-scientists.
2509.07531v1	FLeW: Facet-Level and Adaptive Weighted Representation Learning of Scientific Documents . Scientific document representation learning provides powerful embeddings for various tasks, while current methods face challenges across three approaches. 1) Contrastive training with citation-structural signals underutilizes citation information and still generates single-vector representations. 2) Fine-grained representation learning, which generates multiple vectors at the sentence or aspect level, requires costly integration and lacks domain generalization. 3) Task-aware learning depends on manually predefined task categorization, overlooking nuanced task distinctions and requiring extra training data for task-specific modules. To address these problems, we propose a new method that unifies the three approaches for better representations, namely FLeW. Specifically, we introduce a novel triplet sampling method that leverages citation intent and frequency to enhance citation-structural signals for training. Citation intents (background, method, result), aligned with the general structure of scientific writing, facilitate a domain-generalized facet partition for fine-grained representation learning. Then, we adopt a simple weight search to adaptively integrate three facet-level embeddings into a task-specific document embedding without task-aware fine-tuning. Experiments show the applicability and robustness of FLeW across multiple scientific tasks and fields, compared to prior models.
2509.07759v1	A Survey of Long-Document Retrieval in the PLM and LLM Era . The proliferation of long-form documents presents a fundamental challenge to information retrieval (IR), as their length, dispersed evidence, and complex structures demand specialized methods beyond standard passage-level techniques. This survey provides the first comprehensive treatment of long-document retrieval (LDR), consolidating methods, challenges, and applications across three major eras. We systematize the evolution from classical lexical and early neural models to modern pre-trained (PLM) and large language models (LLMs), covering key paradigms like passage aggregation, hierarchical encoding, efficient attention, and the latest LLM-driven re-ranking and retrieval techniques. Beyond the models, we review domain-specific applications, specialized evaluation resources, and outline critical open challenges such as efficiency trade-offs, multimodal alignment, and faithfulness. This survey aims to provide both a consolidated reference and a forward-looking agenda for advancing long-document retrieval in the era of foundation models.
2509.07801v2	SciNLP: A Domain-Specific Benchmark for Full-Text Scientific Entity and Relation Extraction in NLP . Structured information extraction from scientific literature is crucial for capturing core concepts and emerging trends in specialized fields. While existing datasets aid model development, most focus on specific publication sections due to domain complexity and the high cost of annotating scientific texts. To address this limitation, we introduce SciNLP - a specialized benchmark for full-text entity and relation extraction in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain. The dataset comprises 60 manually annotated full-text NLP publications, covering 7,072 entities and 1,826 relations. Compared to existing research, SciNLP is the first dataset providing full-text annotations of entities and their relationships in the NLP domain. To validate the effectiveness of SciNLP, we conducted comparative experiments with similar datasets and evaluated the performance of state-of-the-art supervised models on this dataset. Results reveal varying extraction capabilities of existing models across academic texts of different lengths. Cross-comparisons with existing datasets show that SciNLP achieves significant performance improvements on certain baseline models. Using models trained on SciNLP, we implemented automatic construction of a fine-grained knowledge graph for the NLP domain. Our KG has an average node degree of 3.2 per entity, indicating rich semantic topological information that enhances downstream applications. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/AKADDC/SciNLP.
2509.08032v1	SciGPT: A Large Language Model for Scientific Literature Understanding and Knowledge Discovery . Scientific literature is growing exponentially, creating a critical bottleneck for researchers to efficiently synthesize knowledge. While general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential in text processing, they often fail to capture scientific domain-specific nuances (e.g., technical jargon, methodological rigor) and struggle with complex scientific tasks, limiting their utility for interdisciplinary research. To address these gaps, this paper presents SciGPT, a domain-adapted foundation model for scientific literature understanding and ScienceBench, an open source benchmark tailored to evaluate scientific LLMs.   Built on the Qwen3 architecture, SciGPT incorporates three key innovations: (1) low-cost domain distillation via a two-stage pipeline to balance performance and efficiency; (2) a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) attention mechanism that cuts memory consumption by 55\% for 32,000-token long-document reasoning; and (3) knowledge-aware adaptation integrating domain ontologies to bridge interdisciplinary knowledge gaps.   Experimental results on ScienceBench show that SciGPT outperforms GPT-4o in core scientific tasks including sequence labeling, generation, and inference. It also exhibits strong robustness in unseen scientific tasks, validating its potential to facilitate AI-augmented scientific discovery.
2509.08216v1	Vector embedding of multi-modal texts: a tool for discovery? . Computer science texts are particularly rich in both narrative content and illustrative charts, algorithms, images, annotated diagrams, etc. This study explores the extent to which vector-based multimodal retrieval, powered by vision-language models (VLMs), can improve discovery across multi-modal (text and images) content. Using over 3,600 digitized textbook pages largely from computer science textbooks and a Vision Language Model (VLM), we generate multi-vector representations capturing both textual and visual semantics. These embeddings are stored in a vector database. We issue a benchmark of 75 natural language queries and compare retrieval performance to ground truth and across four similarity (distance) measures. The study is intended to expose both the strengths and weakenesses of such an approach. We find that cosine similarity most effectively retrieves semantically and visually relevant pages. We further discuss the practicality of using a vector database and multi-modal embedding for operational information retrieval. Our paper is intended to offer design insights for discovery over digital libraries.   Keywords: Vector embedding, multi-modal document retrieval, vector database benchmark, digital library discovery
2509.08266v1	Examining Vision Language Models through Multi-dimensional Experiments with Vision and Text Features . Recent research on Vision Language Models (VLMs) suggests that they rely on inherent biases learned during training to respond to questions about visual properties of an image. These biases are exacerbated when VLMs are asked highly specific questions that require focusing on specific areas of the image. For example, a VLM tasked with counting stars on a modified American flag (e.g., with more than 50 stars) will often disregard the visual evidence and fail to answer accurately. We build upon this research and develop a multi-dimensional examination framework to systematically determine which characteristics of the input data, including both the image and the accompanying prompt, lead to such differences in performance. Using open-source VLMs, we further examine how attention values fluctuate with varying input parameters (e.g., image size, number of objects in the image, background color, prompt specificity). This research aims to learn how the behavior of vision language models changes and to explore methods for characterizing such changes. Our results suggest, among other things, that even minor modifications in image characteristics and prompt specificity can lead to large changes in how a VLM formulates its answer and, subsequently, its overall performance.
2509.08381v1	Low-Resource Fine-Tuning for Multi-Task Structured Information Extraction with a Billion-Parameter Instruction-Tuned Model . Deploying large language models (LLMs) for structured data extraction in domains such as financial compliance reporting, legal document analytics, and multilingual knowledge base construction is often impractical for smaller teams due to the high cost of running large architectures and the difficulty of preparing large, high-quality datasets. Most recent instruction-tuning studies focus on seven-billion-parameter or larger models, leaving limited evidence on whether much smaller models can work reliably under low-resource, multi-task conditions. This work presents ETLCH, a billion-parameter LLaMA-based model fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation on only a few hundred to one thousand samples per task for JSON extraction, knowledge graph extraction, and named entity recognition. Despite its small scale, ETLCH outperforms strong baselines across most evaluation metrics, with substantial gains observed even at the lowest data scale. These findings demonstrate that well-tuned small models can deliver stable and accurate structured outputs at a fraction of the computational cost, enabling cost-effective and reliable information extraction pipelines in resource-constrained environments.
2509.09286v1	Visual Programmability: A Guide for Code-as-Thought in Chart Understanding . Chart understanding presents a critical test to the reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior approaches face critical limitations: some rely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined toolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single reasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate steps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the use of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address this, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual information of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is that this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation consistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is unsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a learnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved with code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive framework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct visual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with reinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a data-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical hallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each strategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments demonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding benchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also how to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each task.
2509.09470v1	AEGIS: An Agent for Extraction and Geographic Identification in Scholarly Proceedings . Keeping pace with the rapid growth of academia literature presents a significant challenge for researchers, funding bodies, and academic societies. To address the time-consuming manual effort required for scholarly discovery, we present a novel, fully automated system that transitions from data discovery to direct action. Our pipeline demonstrates how a specialized AI agent, 'Agent-E', can be tasked with identifying papers from specific geographic regions within conference proceedings and then executing a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to complete a predefined action, such as submitting a nomination form. We validated our system on 586 papers from five different conferences, where it successfully identified every target paper with a recall of 100% and a near perfect accuracy of 99.4%. This demonstration highlights the potential of task-oriented AI agents to not only filter information but also to actively participate in and accelerate the workflows of the academic community.
2509.11937v1	MMORE: Massive Multimodal Open RAG & Extraction . We introduce MMORE, an open-source pipeline for Massive Multimodal Open RetrievalAugmented Generation and Extraction, designed to ingest, transform, and retrieve knowledge from heterogeneous document formats at scale. MMORE supports more than fifteen file types, including text, tables, images, emails, audio, and video, and processes them into a unified format to enable downstream applications for LLMs. The architecture offers modular, distributed processing, enabling scalable parallelization across CPUs and GPUs. On processing benchmarks, MMORE demonstrates a 3.8-fold speedup over single-node baselines and 40% higher accuracy than Docling on scanned PDFs. The pipeline integrates hybrid dense-sparse retrieval and supports both interactive APIs and batch RAG endpoints. Evaluated on PubMedQA, MMORE-augmented medical LLMs improve biomedical QA accuracy with increasing retrieval depth. MMORE provides a robust, extensible foundation for deploying task-agnostic RAG systems on diverse, real-world multimodal data. The codebase is available at https://github.com/swiss-ai/mmore.
2509.11976v1	PoolingVQ: A VQVAE Variant for Reducing Audio Redundancy and Boosting Multi-Modal Fusion in Music Emotion Analysis . Multimodal music emotion analysis leverages audio and MIDI modalities to enhance performance. While mainstream approaches focus on complex feature extraction networks, we posit that shortening the length of audio sequence features to mitigate redundancy, especially in contrast to MIDI's compact representation, may effectively boost task performance. To achieve this, we developed PoolingVQ by combining Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQVAE) with spatial pooling, which directly compresses audio feature sequences through local aggregation to reduce redundancy, then devised a two-stage co-attention approach to fuse audio and MIDI information. Experimental results on the public datasets EMOPIA and VGMIDI demonstrate that our multimodal framework achieves state-of-the-art overall performance, with PoolingVQ yielding some improvement.
2509.12042v1	FinGEAR: Financial Mapping-Guided Enhanced Answer Retrieval . Financial disclosures such as 10-K filings present challenging retrieval problems due to their length, regulatory section hierarchy, and domain-specific language, which standard retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models underuse. We introduce FinGEAR (Financial Mapping-Guided Enhanced Answer Retrieval), a retrieval framework tailored to financial documents. FinGEAR combines a finance lexicon for Item-level guidance (FLAM), dual hierarchical indices for within-Item search (Summary Tree and Question Tree), and a two-stage cross-encoder reranker. This design aligns retrieval with disclosure structure and terminology, enabling fine-grained, query-aware context selection. Evaluated on full 10-Ks with queries aligned to the FinQA dataset, FinGEAR delivers consistent gains in precision, recall, F1, and relevancy, improving F1 by up to 56.7% over flat RAG, 12.5% over graph-based RAGs, and 217.6% over prior tree-based systems, while also increasing downstream answer accuracy with a fixed reader. By jointly modeling section hierarchy and domain lexicon signals, FinGEAR improves retrieval fidelity and provides a practical foundation for high-stakes financial analysis.
2509.13212v2	Extending the BEND Framework to Webgraphs . Attempts to manipulate webgraphs can have many downstream impacts, but analysts lack shared quantitative metrics to characterize actions taken to manipulate information environments at this level. We demonstrate how the BEND framework can be used to characterize attempts to manipulate webgraph information environments, and propose quantitative metrics for BEND community maneuvers. We demonstrate the face validity of our proposed Webgraph BEND metrics by using them to characterize two small web-graphs containing SEO-boosted Kremlin-aligned websites. We demonstrate how our proposed metrics improve BEND scores in webgraph settings and demonstrate the usefulness of our metrics in characterizing webgraph information environments. These metrics offer analysts a systematic and standardized way to characterize attempts to manipulate webgraphs using common Search Engine Optimization tactics.
2509.13603v1	Modernizing Facebook Scoped Search: Keyword and Embedding Hybrid Retrieval with LLM Evaluation . Beyond general web-scale search, social network search uniquely enables users to retrieve information and discover potential connections within their social context. We introduce a framework of modernized Facebook Group Scoped Search by blending traditional keyword-based retrieval with embedding-based retrieval (EBR) to improve the search relevance and diversity of search results. Our system integrates semantic retrieval into the existing keyword search pipeline, enabling users to discover more contextually relevant group posts. To rigorously assess the impact of this blended approach, we introduce a novel evaluation framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to perform offline relevance assessments, providing scalable and consistent quality benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that the blended retrieval system significantly enhances user engagement and search quality, as validated by both online metrics and LLM-based evaluation. This work offers practical insights for deploying and evaluating advanced retrieval systems in large-scale, real-world social platforms.
2509.13676v1	Re-purposing SAM into Efficient Visual Projectors for MLLM-Based Referring Image Segmentation . Recently, Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) frameworks that pair the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have achieved impressive results. However, adapting MLLM to segmentation is computationally intensive, primarily due to visual token redundancy. We observe that traditional patch-wise visual projectors struggle to strike a balance between reducing the number of visual tokens and preserving semantic clarity, often retaining overly long token sequences to avoid performance drops. Inspired by text tokenizers, we propose a novel semantic visual projector that leverages semantic superpixels generated by SAM to identify "visual words" in an image. By compressing and projecting semantic superpixels as visual tokens, our approach adaptively shortens the token sequence according to scene complexity while minimizing semantic loss in compression. To mitigate loss of information, we propose a semantic superpixel positional embedding to strengthen MLLM's awareness of superpixel geometry and position, alongside a semantic superpixel aggregator to preserve both fine-grained details inside superpixels and global context outside. Experiments show that our method cuts visual tokens by 93% without compromising performance, notably speeding up MLLM training and inference, and outperforming existing compressive visual projectors on RIS.
2509.14355v1	Overview of the TREC 2024 NeuCLIR Track . The principal goal of the TREC Neural Cross-Language Information Retrieval (NeuCLIR) track is to study the effect of neural approaches on cross-language information access. The track has created test collections containing Chinese, Persian, and Russian news stories and Chinese academic abstracts. NeuCLIR includes four task types: Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) from news, Multilingual Information Retrieval (MLIR) from news, Report Generation from news, and CLIR from technical documents. A total of 274 runs were submitted by five participating teams (and as baselines by the track coordinators) for eight tasks across these four task types. Task descriptions and the available results are presented.
2509.14746v1	Chain-of-Thought Re-ranking for Image Retrieval Tasks . Image retrieval remains a fundamental yet challenging problem in computer vision. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods typically employ them only for evaluation, without involving them directly in the ranking process. As a result, their rich multimodal reasoning abilities remain underutilized, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Chain-of-Thought Re-Ranking (CoTRR) method to address this issue. Specifically, we design a listwise ranking prompt that enables MLLM to directly participate in re-ranking candidate images. This ranking process is grounded in an image evaluation prompt, which assesses how well each candidate aligns with users query. By allowing MLLM to perform listwise reasoning, our method supports global comparison, consistent reasoning, and interpretable decision-making - all of which are essential for accurate image retrieval. To enable structured and fine-grained analysis, we further introduce a query deconstruction prompt, which breaks down the original query into multiple semantic components. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our CoTRR method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance across three image retrieval tasks, including text-to-image retrieval (TIR), composed image retrieval (CIR) and chat-based image retrieval (Chat-IR). Our code is available at https://github.com/freshfish15/CoTRR .
2509.14749v1	Evaluating Large Language Models for Cross-Lingual Retrieval . Multi-stage information retrieval (IR) has become a widely-adopted paradigm in search. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated as second-stage reranking models for monolingual IR, a systematic large-scale comparison is still lacking for cross-lingual IR (CLIR). Moreover, while prior work shows that LLM-based rerankers improve CLIR performance, their evaluation setup relies on lexical retrieval with machine translation (MT) for the first stage. This is not only prohibitively expensive but also prone to error propagation across stages. Our evaluation on passage-level and document-level CLIR reveals that further gains can be achieved with multilingual bi-encoders as first-stage retrievers and that the benefits of translation diminishes with stronger reranking models. We further show that pairwise rerankers based on instruction-tuned LLMs perform competitively with listwise rerankers. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the interaction between retrievers and rerankers in two-stage CLIR with LLMs. Our findings reveal that, without MT, current state-of-the-art rerankers fall severely short when directly applied in CLIR.
2509.14943v1	Explicit vs. Implicit Biographies: Evaluating and Adapting LLM Information Extraction on Wikidata-Derived Texts . Text Implicitness has always been challenging in Natural Language Processing (NLP), with traditional methods relying on explicit statements to identify entities and their relationships. From the sentence "Zuhdi attends church every Sunday", the relationship between Zuhdi and Christianity is evident for a human reader, but it presents a challenge when it must be inferred automatically. Large language models (LLMs) have proven effective in NLP downstream tasks such as text comprehension and information extraction (IE).   This study examines how textual implicitness affects IE tasks in pre-trained LLMs: LLaMA 2.3, DeepSeekV1, and Phi1.5. We generate two synthetic datasets of 10k implicit and explicit verbalization of biographic information to measure the impact on LLM performance and analyze whether fine-tuning implicit data improves their ability to generalize in implicit reasoning tasks.   This research presents an experiment on the internal reasoning processes of LLMs in IE, particularly in dealing with implicit and explicit contexts. The results demonstrate that fine-tuning LLM models with LoRA (low-rank adaptation) improves their performance in extracting information from implicit texts, contributing to better model interpretability and reliability.
2509.17455v1	Codifying Natural Langauge Tasks . We explore the applicability of text-to-code to solve real-world problems that are typically solved in natural language, such as legal judgment and medical QA. Unlike previous works, our approach leverages the explicit reasoning provided by program generation. We present ICRAG, a framework that transforms natural language into executable programs through iterative refinement using external knowledge from domain resources and GitHub. Across 13 benchmarks, ICRAG achieves up to 161.1\% relative improvement. We provide a detailed analysis of the generated code and the impact of external knowledge, and we discuss the limitations of applying text-to-code approaches to real-world natural language tasks.
2509.17469v1	LongEval at CLEF 2025: Longitudinal Evaluation of IR Systems on Web and Scientific Data . The LongEval lab focuses on the evaluation of information retrieval systems over time. Two datasets are provided that capture evolving search scenarios with changing documents, queries, and relevance assessments. Systems are assessed from a temporal perspective-that is, evaluating retrieval effectiveness as the data they operate on changes. In its third edition, LongEval featured two retrieval tasks: one in the area of ad-hoc web retrieval, and another focusing on scientific article retrieval. We present an overview of this year's tasks and datasets, as well as the participating systems. A total of 19 teams submitted their approaches, which we evaluated using nDCG and a variety of measures that quantify changes in retrieval effectiveness over time.
2509.17486v1	AttnComp: Attention-Guided Adaptive Context Compression for Retrieval-Augmented Generation . Retrieval-augmented generation improves the factual accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating external context, but often suffers from irrelevant retrieved content that hinders effectiveness. Context compression addresses this issue by filtering out irrelevant information from context before LLM generation. However, existing methods struggle to adaptively adjust compression rates for different context, maintain low latency and integrate information across multiple documents. To overcome these limitations, We introduce AttnComp, an adaptive, efficient and context-aware compression framework. By leveraging the attention mechanism of LLMs to identify relevant information, AttnComp employs a Top-P compression algorithm to retain the minimal set of documents whose cumulative attention weights exceeds a predefined threshold. In addition to compression, AttnComp estimates response confidence by assessing the overall relevance of the retrieved content, enabling users to gauge response reliability. Experiments demonstrate that AttnComp outperforms existing compression methods and uncompressed baselines, achieving higher accuracy with substantial compression rates and lower latency.
2509.17737v2	Breaking Token Into Concepts: Exploring Extreme Compression in Token Representation Via Compositional Shared Semantics . Standard language models employ unique, monolithic embeddings for each token, potentially limiting their ability to capture the multifaceted nature of word meanings. We investigate whether tokens can be more effectively represented through a compositional structure that accumulates diverse semantic facets. To explore this, we propose Aggregate Semantic Grouping (ASG), a novel approach leveraging Product Quantization (PQ). We apply ASG to standard transformer architectures (mBERT, XLM-R, mT5) and evaluate this representational scheme across diverse tasks (NLI, NER, QA), as well as a biomedical domain-specific benchmark (BC5CDR) using BioBERT. Our findings demonstrate that representing tokens compositionally via ASG achieves extreme compression in embedding parameters (0.4--0.5\%) while maintaining $>$95\% task performance relative to the base model, even in generative tasks and extends to both cross lingual transfer and domain-specific settings. These results validate the principle that tokens can be effectively modeled as combinations of shared semantic building blocks. ASG offers a simple yet concrete method for achieving this, showcasing how compositional representations can capture linguistic richness while enabling compact yet semantically rich models.
2509.18091v1	OnePiece: Bringing Context Engineering and Reasoning to Industrial Cascade Ranking System . Despite the growing interest in replicating the scaled success of large language models (LLMs) in industrial search and recommender systems, most existing industrial efforts remain limited to transplanting Transformer architectures, which bring only incremental improvements over strong Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs). From a first principle perspective, the breakthroughs of LLMs stem not only from their architectures but also from two complementary mechanisms: context engineering, which enriches raw input queries with contextual cues to better elicit model capabilities, and multi-step reasoning, which iteratively refines model outputs through intermediate reasoning paths. However, these two mechanisms and their potential to unlock substantial improvements remain largely underexplored in industrial ranking systems.   In this paper, we propose OnePiece, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-style context engineering and reasoning into both retrieval and ranking models of industrial cascaded pipelines. OnePiece is built on a pure Transformer backbone and further introduces three key innovations: (1) structured context engineering, which augments interaction history with preference and scenario signals and unifies them into a structured tokenized input sequence for both retrieval and ranking; (2) block-wise latent reasoning, which equips the model with multi-step refinement of representations and scales reasoning bandwidth via block size; (3) progressive multi-task training, which leverages user feedback chains to effectively supervise reasoning steps during training. OnePiece has been deployed in the main personalized search scenario of Shopee and achieves consistent online gains across different key business metrics, including over $+2\%$ GMV/UU and a $+2.90\%$ increase in advertising revenue.
2509.18763v1	Bi-VLM: Pushing Ultra-Low Precision Post-Training Quantization Boundaries in Vision-Language Models . We address the critical gap between the computational demands of vision-language models and the possible ultra-low-bit weight precision (bitwidth $\leq2$ bits) we can use for higher efficiency. Our work is motivated by the substantial computational cost and memory requirements of VLMs, which restrict their applicability in hardware-constrained environments. We propose Bi-VLM, which separates model weights non-uniformly based on the Gaussian quantiles. Our formulation groups the model weights into outlier (salient) and multiple inlier (unsalient) subsets, ensuring that each subset contains a proportion of weights corresponding to its quantile in the distribution. We propose a saliency-aware hybrid quantization algorithm and use it to quantize weights by imposing different constraints on the scaler and binary matrices based on the saliency metric and compression objective. We have evaluated our approach on different VLMs. For the language model part of the VLM, our Bi-VLM outperforms the SOTA by 3%-47% on the visual question answering task in terms of four different benchmarks and three different models. For the overall VLM, our Bi-VLM outperforms the SOTA by 4%-45%. We also perform token pruning on the quantized models and observe that there is redundancy of image tokens 90% - 99% in the quantized models. This helps us to further prune the visual tokens to improve efficiency.
2509.19191v1	Reading Images Like Texts: Sequential Image Understanding in Vision-Language Models . Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a variety of real-world tasks. However, existing VLMs typically process visual information by serializing images, a method that diverges significantly from the parallel nature of human vision. Moreover, their opaque internal mechanisms hinder both deeper understanding and architectural innovation. Inspired by the dual-stream hypothesis of human vision, which distinguishes the "what" and "where" pathways, we deconstruct the visual processing in VLMs into object recognition and spatial perception for separate study. For object recognition, we convert images into text token maps and find that the model's perception of image content unfolds as a two-stage process from shallow to deep layers, beginning with attribute recognition and culminating in semantic disambiguation. For spatial perception, we theoretically derive and empirically verify the geometric structure underlying the positional representation in VLMs. Based on these findings, we introduce an instruction-agnostic token compression algorithm based on a plug-and-play visual decoder to improve decoding efficiency, and a RoPE scaling technique to enhance spatial reasoning. Through rigorous experiments, our work validates these analyses, offering a deeper understanding of VLM internals and providing clear principles for designing more capable future architectures.
2509.19203v1	Vision-Free Retrieval: Rethinking Multimodal Search with Textual Scene Descriptions . Contrastively-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have become the standard approach for learning discriminative vision-language representations. However, these models often exhibit shallow language understanding, manifesting bag-of-words behaviour. These limitations are reinforced by their dual-encoder design, which induces a modality gap. Additionally, the reliance on vast web-collected data corpora for training makes the process computationally expensive and introduces significant privacy concerns. To address these limitations, in this work, we challenge the necessity of vision encoders for retrieval tasks by introducing a vision-free, single-encoder retrieval pipeline. Departing from the traditional text-to-image retrieval paradigm, we migrate to a text-to-text paradigm with the assistance of VLLM-generated structured image descriptions. We demonstrate that this paradigm shift has significant advantages, including a substantial reduction of the modality gap, improved compositionality, and better performance on short and long caption queries, all attainable with only a few hours of calibration on two GPUs. Additionally, substituting raw images with textual descriptions introduces a more privacy-friendly alternative for retrieval. To further assess generalisation and address some of the shortcomings of prior compositionality benchmarks, we release two benchmarks derived from Flickr30k and COCO, containing diverse compositional queries made of short captions, which we coin subFlickr and subCOCO. Our vision-free retriever matches and often surpasses traditional multimodal models. Importantly, our approach achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on multiple retrieval and compositionality benchmarks, with models as small as 0.3B parameters. Code is available at: https://github.com/IoannaNti/LexiCLIP
2509.19952v1	When Words Can't Capture It All: Towards Video-Based User Complaint Text Generation with Multimodal Video Complaint Dataset . While there exists a lot of work on explainable complaint mining, articulating user concerns through text or video remains a significant challenge, often leaving issues unresolved. Users frequently struggle to express their complaints clearly in text but can easily upload videos depicting product defects (e.g., vague text such as `worst product' paired with a 5-second video depicting a broken headphone with the right earcup). This paper formulates a new task in the field of complaint mining to aid the common users' need to write an expressive complaint, which is Complaint Description from Videos (CoD-V) (e.g., to help the above user articulate her complaint about the defective right earcup). To this end, we introduce ComVID, a video complaint dataset containing 1,175 complaint videos and the corresponding descriptions, also annotated with the emotional state of the complainer. Additionally, we present a new complaint retention (CR) evaluation metric that discriminates the proposed (CoD-V) task against standard video summary generation and description tasks. To strengthen this initiative, we introduce a multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) embedded VideoLLaMA2-7b model, designed to generate complaints while accounting for the user's emotional state. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of several Video Language Models on several tasks (pre-trained and fine-tuned versions) with a range of established evaluation metrics, including METEOR, perplexity, and the Coleman-Liau readability score, among others. Our study lays the foundation for a new research direction to provide a platform for users to express complaints through video. Dataset and resources are available at: https://github.com/sarmistha-D/CoD-V.
2509.20119v1	A Simple Data Augmentation Strategy for Text-in-Image Scientific VQA . Scientific visual question answering poses significant challenges for vision-language models due to the complexity of scientific figures and their multimodal context. Traditional approaches treat the figure and accompanying text (e.g., questions and answer options) as separate inputs. EXAMS-V introduced a new paradigm by embedding both visual and textual content into a single image. However, even state-of-the-art proprietary models perform poorly on this setup in zero-shot settings, underscoring the need for task-specific fine-tuning. To address the scarcity of training data in this "text-in-image" format, we synthesize a new dataset by converting existing separate image-text pairs into unified images. Fine-tuning a small multilingual multimodal model on a mix of our synthetic data and EXAMS-V yields notable gains across 13 languages, demonstrating strong average improvements and cross-lingual transfer.
2509.20484v1	Data-Efficient Stream-Based Active Distillation for Scalable Edge Model Deployment . Edge camera-based systems are continuously expanding, facing ever-evolving environments that require regular model updates. In practice, complex teacher models are run on a central server to annotate data, which is then used to train smaller models tailored to the edge devices with limited computational power. This work explores how to select the most useful images for training to maximize model quality while keeping transmission costs low. Our work shows that, for a similar training load (i.e., iterations), a high-confidence stream-based strategy coupled with a diversity-based approach produces a high-quality model with minimal dataset queries.
2509.20751v1	Seeing Through Words, Speaking Through Pixels: Deep Representational Alignment Between Vision and Language Models . Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios, and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered (e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task shows that human preferences for image-caption matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.
2509.20804v1	Performance Consistency of Learning Methods for Information Retrieval Tasks . A range of approaches have been proposed for estimating the accuracy or robustness of the measured performance of IR methods. One is to use bootstrapping of test sets, which, as we confirm, provides an estimate of variation in performance. For IR methods that rely on a seed, such as those that involve machine learning, another approach is to use a random set of seeds to examine performance variation. Using three different IR tasks we have used such randomness to examine a range of traditional statistical learning models and transformer-based learning models. While the statistical models are stable, the transformer models show huge variation as seeds are changed. In 9 of 11 cases the F1-scores (in the range 0.0--1.0) had a standard deviation of over 0.075; while 7 of 11 precision values (also in the range 0.0--1.0) had a standard deviation of over 0.125. This is in a context where differences of less than 0.02 have been used as evidence of method improvement. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of transformer models to training instabilities and moreover raise questions about the reliability of previous results, thus underscoring the need for rigorous evaluation practices.
2509.20820v1	Distilling Many-Shot In-Context Learning into a Cheat Sheet . Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable effective in-context learning (ICL) with many-shot examples, but at the cost of high computational demand due to longer input tokens. To address this, we propose cheat-sheet ICL, which distills the information from many-shot ICL into a concise textual summary (cheat sheet) used as the context at inference time. Experiments on challenging reasoning tasks show that cheat-sheet ICL achieves comparable or better performance than many-shot ICL with far fewer tokens, and matches retrieval-based ICL without requiring test-time retrieval. These findings demonstrate that cheat-sheet ICL is a practical alternative for leveraging LLMs in downstream tasks.
2509.20940v1	Markup Language Modeling for Web Document Understanding . Web information extraction (WIE) is an important part of many e-commerce systems, supporting tasks like customer analysis and product recommendation. In this work, we look at the problem of building up-to-date product databases by extracting detailed information from shopping review websites. We fine-tuned MarkupLM on product data gathered from review sites of different sizes and then developed a variant we call MarkupLM++, which extends predictions to internal nodes of the DOM tree. Our experiments show that using larger and more diverse training sets improves extraction accuracy overall. We also find that including internal nodes helps with some product attributes, although it leads to a slight drop in overall performance. The final model reached a precision of 0.906, recall of 0.724, and an F1 score of 0.805.
2509.21028v1	Who Gets Cited Most? Benchmarking Long-Context Language Models on Scientific Articles . This paper introduces SciTrek, a novel question-answering benchmark designed to evaluate the long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) using scientific articles. Current long-context benchmarks often rely on non-scientific texts, focus on simple information retrieval tasks, or employ artificial contexts. SciTrek addresses these limitations by proposing complex questions that require information aggregation and synthesis across multiple full-text scientific articles. Questions and their ground-truth answers are automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database constructed from article metadata (titles, authors, and references). The SQL operations provide explicit, verifiable reasoning steps for fine-grained error analysis, and the construction process scales to contexts up to 1M tokens with minimal supervision. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of open-weight and proprietary LLMs demonstrate that SciTrek poses a significant challenge as the context length increases, with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning offering only limited gains. Our analysis reveals systematic shortcomings in models' abilities to perform basic numerical operations and accurately locate specific information in long contexts.
2509.21040v1	Generative AI for FFRDCs . Federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) face text-heavy workloads, from policy documents to scientific and engineering papers, that are slow to analyze manually. We show how large language models can accelerate summarization, classification, extraction, and sense-making with only a few input-output examples. To enable use in sensitive government contexts, we apply OnPrem$.$LLM, an open-source framework for secure and flexible application of generative AI. Case studies on defense policy documents and scientific corpora, including the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and National Science Foundation (NSF) Awards, demonstrate how this approach enhances oversight and strategic analysis while maintaining auditability and data sovereignty.
2509.21179v1	IntSR: An Integrated Generative Framework for Search and Recommendation . Generative recommendation has emerged as a promising paradigm, demonstrating remarkable results in both academic benchmarks and industrial applications. However, existing systems predominantly focus on unifying retrieval and ranking while neglecting the integration of search and recommendation (S&R) tasks. What makes search and recommendation different is how queries are formed: search uses explicit user requests, while recommendation relies on implicit user interests. As for retrieval versus ranking, the distinction comes down to whether the queries are the target items themselves. Recognizing the query as central element, we propose IntSR, an integrated generative framework for S&R. IntSR integrates these disparate tasks using distinct query modalities. It also addresses the increased computational complexity associated with integrated S&R behaviors and the erroneous pattern learning introduced by a dynamically changing corpus. IntSR has been successfully deployed across various scenarios in Amap, leading to substantial improvements in digital asset's GMV(+3.02%), POI recommendation's CTR(+2.76%), and travel mode suggestion's ACC(+5.13%).
2509.21227v1	Evaluating the Evaluators: Metrics for Compositional Text-to-Image Generation . Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation. Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment. These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models in generation.

2509.21259v1	Semantic Edge-Cloud Communication for Real-Time Urban Traffic Surveillance with ViT and LLMs over Mobile Networks . Real-time urban traffic surveillance is vital for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to ensure road safety, optimize traffic flow, track vehicle trajectories, and prevent collisions in smart cities. Deploying edge cameras across urban environments is a standard practice for monitoring road conditions. However, integrating these with intelligent models requires a robust understanding of dynamic traffic scenarios and a responsive interface for user interaction. Although multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) can interpret traffic images and generate informative responses, their deployment on edge devices is infeasible due to high computational demands. Therefore, LLM inference must occur on the cloud, necessitating visual data transmission from edge to cloud, a process hindered by limited bandwidth, leading to potential delays that compromise real-time performance. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic communication framework that significantly reduces transmission overhead. Our method involves detecting Regions of Interest (RoIs) using YOLOv11, cropping relevant image segments, and converting them into compact embedding vectors using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These embeddings are then transmitted to the cloud, where an image decoder reconstructs the cropped images. The reconstructed images are processed by a multimodal LLM to generate traffic condition descriptions. This approach achieves a 99.9% reduction in data transmission size while maintaining an LLM response accuracy of 89% for reconstructed cropped images, compared to 93% accuracy with original cropped images. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of ViT and LLM-assisted edge-cloud semantic communication for real-time traffic surveillance.
2509.24258v1	When MLLMs Meet Compression Distortion: A Coding Paradigm Tailored to MLLMs . The increasing deployment of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), typically hosted on cloud platforms, urgently requires effective compression techniques to efficiently transmit signal inputs (e.g., images, videos) from edge devices with minimal bandwidth usage. However, conventional image codecs are optimized for fidelity to serve the Human Visual System (HVS) and ill-suited for MLLMs, in which diverse downstream tasks are jointly considered. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the impact of compression artifacts on several mainstream MLLMs. We find that: Compression distortion unevenly impacts different-level image features, leading to varying effects on MLLMs' downstream tasks depending on their feature-level reliance. Motivated by this discovery, we propose an image Codec TAilored to MLLMs (CoTAM) designed to adaptively protect multi-level features and suit different demands of downstream tasks. The encoder leverages CLIP's shallow-layer attention to generate an importance map for bit allocation, preserving critical semantic regions. Concurrently, the decoder integrates a lightweight adapter with a multi-level loss function to ensure the faithful reconstruction both of low-level details and high-level semantic context for robust synthesis of cross-level features. Extensive experiments validate that our method achieves up to 35.99\% bitrate saving while maintaining the same performance on the MLLM tasks, outperforming previous SOTA neural codecs.
2509.24283v1	Overview of SCIDOCA 2025 Shared Task on Citation Prediction, Discovery, and Placement . We present an overview of the SCIDOCA 2025 Shared Task, which focuses on citation discovery and prediction in scientific documents. The task is divided into three subtasks: (1) Citation Discovery, where systems must identify relevant references for a given paragraph; (2) Masked Citation Prediction, which requires selecting the correct citation for masked citation slots; and (3) Citation Sentence Prediction, where systems must determine the correct reference for each cited sentence. We release a large-scale dataset constructed from the Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus (S2ORC), containing over 60,000 annotated paragraphs and a curated reference set. The test set consists of 1,000 paragraphs from distinct papers, each annotated with ground-truth citations and distractor candidates. A total of seven teams registered, with three submitting results. We report performance metrics across all subtasks and analyze the effectiveness of submitted systems. This shared task provides a new benchmark for evaluating citation modeling and encourages future research in scientific document understanding. The dataset and task materials are publicly available at https://github.com/daotuanan/scidoca2025-shared-task.
2509.24431v1	Semantic Compression via Multimodal Representation Learning . Multimodal representation learning produces high-dimensional embeddings that align diverse modalities in a shared latent space. While this enables strong generalization, it also introduces scalability challenges, both in terms of storage and downstream processing. A key open problem is how to achieve semantic compression, reducing the memory footprint of multimodal embeddings while preserving their ability to represent shared semantic content across modalities. In this paper, we prove a strong connection between reducing the modality gap, which is the residual separation of embeddings from different modalities, and the feasibility of post-training semantic compression. When the gap is sufficiently reduced, embeddings from different modalities but expressing the same semantics share a common portion of the space. Therefore, their centroid is a faithful representation of such a semantic concept. This enables replacing multiple embeddings with a single centroid, yielding significant memory savings. We propose a novel approach for semantic compression grounded on the latter intuition, operating directly on pretrained encoders. We demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse large-scale multimodal downstream tasks. Our results highlight that modality alignment is a key enabler for semantic compression, showing that the proposed approach achieves significant compression without sacrificing performance.
2509.24791v1	Vision Function Layer in Multimodal LLMs . This study identifies that visual-related functional decoding is distributed across different decoder layers in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Typically, each function, such as counting, grounding, or OCR recognition, narrows down to two or three layers, which we define as Vision Function Layers (VFL). Additionally, the depth and its order of different VFLs exhibits a consistent pattern across different MLLMs, which is well-aligned with human behaviors (e.g., recognition occurs first, followed by counting, and then grounding). These findings are derived from Visual Token Swapping, our novel analytical framework that modifies targeted KV cache entries to precisely elucidate layer-specific functions during decoding. Furthermore, these insights offer substantial utility in tailoring MLLMs for real-world downstream applications. For instance, when LoRA training is selectively applied to VFLs whose functions align with the training data, VFL-LoRA not only outperform full-LoRA but also prevent out-of-domain function forgetting. Moreover, by analyzing the performance differential on training data when particular VFLs are ablated, VFL-select automatically classifies data by function, enabling highly efficient data selection to directly bolster corresponding capabilities. Consequently, VFL-select surpasses human experts in data selection, and achieves 98% of full-data performance with only 20% of the original dataset. This study delivers deeper comprehension of MLLM visual processing, fostering the creation of more efficient, interpretable, and robust models.
2509.24869v1	Retro*: Optimizing LLMs for Reasoning-Intensive Document Retrieval . With the growing popularity of LLM agents and RAG, it has become increasingly important to retrieve documents that are essential for solving a task, even when their connection to the task is indirect or implicit. Addressing this problem requires fine-grained reasoning to accurately assess the relevance between the task and each candidate document. This capability, however, poses a significant challenge for existing IR techniques. Despite recent progress in reasoning-enhanced IR, existing approaches still face significant challenges in applicability, scalability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose Retro*, a novel approach for reasoning-intensive document retrieval. Our method introduces a rubric-based relevance scoring mechanism, enabling the model to reason about the relationship between a task and a document based on explicitly defined criteria, whereby producing a fine-grained, interpretable relevance score. Retro* also supports test-time scaling by combining multiple reasoning trajectories via score integration, which produces more reliable relevance estimates. To optimize Retro*'s reasoning capabilities, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for its relevance scoring mechanism, which employs two composite rewards to fully exploit the trajectories of each training sample. Our experiments show that Retro* outperforms existing document retrieval methods with notable advantages, leading to state-of-the-art performance on the BRIGHT benchmark.
2509.25085v1	jina-reranker-v3: Last but Not Late Interaction for Document Reranking . jina-reranker-v3 is a 0.6B parameter multilingual document reranker that introduces a novel last but not late interaction. Unlike late interaction models such as ColBERT that perform separate encoding followed by multi-vector matching, our approach conducts causal self-attention between query and documents within the same context window, enabling rich cross-document interactions before extracting contextual embeddings from the last token of each document. This compact architecture achieves state-of-the-art BEIR performance with 61.94 nDCG@10 while being ten times smaller than generative listwise rerankers.
2509.25107v1	Knowledge Extraction on Semi-Structured Content: Does It Remain Relevant for Question Answering in the Era of LLMs? . The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced web-based Question Answering (QA) systems over semi-structured content, raising questions about the continued utility of knowledge extraction for question answering. This paper investigates the value of triple extraction in this new paradigm by extending an existing benchmark with knowledge extraction annotations and evaluating commercial and open-source LLMs of varying sizes. Our results show that web-scale knowledge extraction remains a challenging task for LLMs. Despite achieving high QA accuracy, LLMs can still benefit from knowledge extraction, through augmentation with extracted triples and multi-task learning. These findings provide insights into the evolving role of knowledge triple extraction in web-based QA and highlight strategies for maximizing LLM effectiveness across different model sizes and resource settings.
2509.25716v1	DeepCodeSeek: Real-Time API Retrieval for Context-Aware Code Generation . Current search techniques are limited to standard RAG query-document applications. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to expand the code and index for predicting the required APIs, directly enabling high-quality, end-to-end code generation for auto-completion and agentic AI applications. We address the problem of API leaks in current code-to-code benchmark datasets by introducing a new dataset built from real-world ServiceNow Script Includes that capture the challenge of unclear API usage intent in the code. Our evaluation metrics show that this method achieves 87.86% top-40 retrieval accuracy, allowing the critical context with APIs needed for successful downstream code generation. To enable real-time predictions, we develop a comprehensive post-training pipeline that optimizes a compact 0.6B reranker through synthetic dataset generation, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. This approach enables our compact reranker to outperform a much larger 8B model while maintaining 2.5x reduced latency, effectively addressing the nuances of enterprise-specific code without the computational overhead of larger models.
2509.25745v1	FinCap: Topic-Aligned Captions for Short-Form Financial YouTube Videos . We evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for topic-aligned captioning in financial short-form videos (SVs) by testing joint reasoning over transcripts (T), audio (A), and video (V). Using 624 annotated YouTube SVs, we assess all seven modality combinations (T, A, V, TA, TV, AV, TAV) across five topics: main recommendation, sentiment analysis, video purpose, visual analysis, and financial entity recognition. Video alone performs strongly on four of five topics, underscoring its value for capturing visual context and effective cues such as emotions, gestures, and body language. Selective pairs such as TV or AV often surpass TAV, implying that too many modalities may introduce noise. These results establish the first baselines for financial short-form video captioning and illustrate the potential and challenges of grounding complex visual cues in this domain. All code and data can be found on our Github under the CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.
2509.25848v1	More Thought, Less Accuracy? On the Dual Nature of Reasoning in Vision-Language Models . Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models (LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems, it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories. Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a wide range of established benchmarks. Project page: https://xytian1008.github.io/VAPO/
2509.26225v1	An Experimental Study on Generating Plausible Textual Explanations for Video Summarization . In this paper, we present our experimental study on generating plausible textual explanations for the outcomes of video summarization. For the needs of this study, we extend an existing framework for multigranular explanation of video summarization by integrating a SOTA Large Multimodal Model (LLaVA-OneVision) and prompting it to produce natural language descriptions of the obtained visual explanations. Following, we focus on one of the most desired characteristics for explainable AI, the plausibility of the obtained explanations that relates with their alignment with the humans' reasoning and expectations. Using the extended framework, we propose an approach for evaluating the plausibility of visual explanations by quantifying the semantic overlap between their textual descriptions and the textual descriptions of the corresponding video summaries, with the help of two methods for creating sentence embeddings (SBERT, SimCSE). Based on the extended framework and the proposed plausibility evaluation approach, we conduct an experimental study using a SOTA method (CA-SUM) and two datasets (SumMe, TVSum) for video summarization, to examine whether the more faithful explanations are also the more plausible ones, and identify the most appropriate approach for generating plausible textual explanations for video summarization.
2509.26235v1	Interpret, prune and distill Donut : towards lightweight VLMs for VQA on document . Recent advances in Visually-rich Document Understanding rely on large Vision-Language Models like Donut, which perform document-level Visual Question Answering without Optical Character Recognition. Despite their effectiveness, these models are too costly for real-time or resource-constrained applications. We investigate model compression through knowledge distillation, training compact student models from a larger teacher. We leverage mechanistic interpretability to drive student architecture design within this framework. By analyzing internal computations, we identify essential subcomponents to retain, while having a clear view of which subcomponents should be approximated, skipped, or reparametrized based on their function. This approach yields Donut-MINT (Mechanistic Interpretability-based Network Trimming), a pruned Donut variant that reduces inference time and memory usage while maintaining strong performance on DocVQA, a standard benchmark for document Visual Question Answering. Our method reframes compression as circuit discovery, bridging interpretability research and practical Vision-Language Model deployment.
2510.01612v1	RAG-BioQA Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Long-Form Biomedical Question Answering . The exponential growth of biomedical literature creates significant challenges for accessing precise medical information. Current biomedical question-answering systems primarily focus on short-form answers, failing to provide the comprehensive explanations necessary for clinical decision-making. We present RAG-BioQA, a novel framework combining retrieval-augmented generation with domain-specific fine-tuning to produce evidence-based, long-form biomedical answers. Our approach integrates BioBERT embeddings with FAISS indexing and compares various re-ranking strategies (BM25, ColBERT, MonoT5) to optimize context selection before synthesizing evidence through a fine-tuned T5 model. Experimental results on the PubMedQA dataset show significant improvements over baselines, with our best model achieving substantial gains across BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR metrics, advancing the state of accessible, evidence-based biomedical knowledge retrieval.
2510.01681v1	Look Less, Reason More: Rollout-Guided Adaptive Pixel-Space Reasoning . Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet they frequently struggle with tasks requiring precise understanding and handling of fine-grained visual elements. This is mainly due to information loss during image encoding or insufficient attention to critical regions. Recent work has shown promise by incorporating pixel-level visual information into the reasoning process, enabling VLMs to access high-resolution visual details during their thought process. However, this pixel-level information is often overused, leading to inefficiency and distraction from irrelevant visual details. To address these challenges, we propose the first framework for adaptive pixel reasoning that dynamically determines necessary pixel-level operations based on the input query. Specifically, we first apply operation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence in textual reasoning and visual operations, then design a novel rollout-guided reinforcement learning framework relying on feedback of the model's own responses, which enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be invoked based on query difficulty. Experiments on extensive multimodal reasoning benchmarks show that our model achieves superior performance while significantly reducing unnecessary visual operations. Impressively, our model achieves 73.4\% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while maintaining a tool usage ratio of only 20.1\%, improving accuracy and simultaneously reducing tool usage by 66.5\% compared to the previous methods.
2510.01832v1	SCRIBES: Web-Scale Script-Based Semi-Structured Data Extraction with Reinforcement Learning . Semi-structured content in HTML tables, lists, and infoboxes accounts for a substantial share of factual data on the web, yet the formatting complicates usage, and reliably extracting structured information from them remains challenging. Existing methods either lack generalization or are resource-intensive due to per-page LLM inference. In this paper, we introduce SCRIBES (SCRIpt-Based Semi-Structured Content Extraction at Web-Scale), a novel reinforcement learning framework that leverages layout similarity across webpages within the same site as a reward signal. Instead of processing each page individually, SCRIBES generates reusable extraction scripts that can be applied to groups of structurally similar webpages. Our approach further improves by iteratively training on synthetic annotations from in-the-wild CommonCrawl data. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong baselines by over 13% in script quality and boosts downstream question answering accuracy by more than 4% for GPT-4o, enabling scalable and resource-efficient web information extraction.
2510.09471v1	Getting Your Indices in a Row: Full-Text Search for LLM Training Data for Real World . The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is determined by their training data. Despite the proliferation of open-weight LLMs, access to LLM training data has remained limited. Even for fully open LLMs, the scale of the data makes it all but inscrutable to the general scientific community, despite potentially containing critical data scraped from the internet.   In this paper, we present the full-text indexing pipeline for the Apertus LLM training data. Leveraging Elasticsearch parallel indices and the Alps infrastructure, a state-of-the-art, highly energy-efficient arm64 supercluster, we were able to index 8.6T tokens out of 15.2T used to train the Apertus LLM family, creating both a critical LLM safety tool and effectively an offline, curated, open web search engine. Our contribution is threefold. First, we demonstrate that Elasticsearch can be successfully ported onto next-generation arm64-based infrastructure. Second, we demonstrate that full-text indexing at the scale of modern LLM training datasets and the entire open web is feasible and accessible. Finally, we demonstrate that such indices can be used to ensure previously inaccessible jailbreak-agnostic LLM safety.   We hope that our findings will be useful to other teams attempting large-scale data indexing and facilitate the general transition towards greener computation.
2510.10909v1	PaperArena: An Evaluation Benchmark for Tool-Augmented Agentic Reasoning on Scientific Literature . Understanding and reasoning on the web-scale scientific literature is a crucial touchstone for large language model (LLM) based agents designed to support complex knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing works are mainly restricted to tool-free tasks within isolated papers, largely due to the lack of a benchmark for cross-paper reasoning and multi-tool orchestration in real research scenarios. In this work, we propose PaperArena, an evaluation benchmark for agents to address real-world research questions that typically require integrating information across multiple papers with the assistance of external tools. Given a research question, agents should integrate diverse formats across multiple papers through reasoning and interacting with appropriate tools, thereby producing a well-grounded answer. To support standardized evaluation, we provide a modular and extensible platform for agent execution, offering tools such as multimodal parsing, context retrieval, and programmatic computation. Experimental results reveal that even the most advanced LLM powering a well-established agent system achieves merely 38.78% average accuracy. On the hard subset, accuracy drops to only 18.47%, highlighting great potential for improvement. We also present several empirical findings, including that all agents tested exhibit inefficient tool usage, often invoking more tools than necessary to solve a task. We invite the community to adopt PaperArena to develop and evaluate more capable agents for scientific discovery. Our code and data are available https://github.com/Melmaphother/PaperArena.
2510.11234v1	Neural Weight Compression for Language Models . The efficient storage and transmission of language model weights is becoming increasingly important, as their scale and adoption continue to grow. However, as our understanding of this new data modality is limited, designing a good compression algorithm for language model weights heavily relies on manual, trial-and-error approaches. In this paper, we propose a learned compression framework that trains neural codecs directly from pretrained language model weights. Unlike conventional data (e.g., images), language model weights pose unique challenges: the sizes and shapes of weight tensors vary significantly, and the reconstruction quality must be judged by downstream model predictions rather than na\"ive MSE loss. To address this, we introduce Neural Weight Compression (NWC), a novel autoencoder-based neural codec tailored to model weight compression. The proposed method inherits the advantages of autoencoder-based codecs while incorporating three technical components: (1) column-wise tensor chunking and normalization; (2) an importance-aware training loss; (3) an inference-time error compensation mechanism guided by model outputs. Experiments on open-weight language models show that NWC achieves competitive or state-of-the-art accuracy-compression tradeoffs, with particularly strong results at 4-6 bit precisions where accuracy remains nearly on par with FP16 models.
2510.11409v1	Leveraging LLMs for Semi-Automatic Corpus Filtration in Systematic Literature Reviews . The creation of systematic literature reviews (SLR) is critical for analyzing the landscape of a research field and guiding future research directions. However, retrieving and filtering the literature corpus for an SLR is highly time-consuming and requires extensive manual effort, as keyword-based searches in digital libraries often return numerous irrelevant publications. In this work, we propose a pipeline leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs), classifying papers based on descriptive prompts and deciding jointly using a consensus scheme. The entire process is human-supervised and interactively controlled via our open-source visual analytics web interface, LLMSurver, which enables real-time inspection and modification of model outputs. We evaluate our approach using ground-truth data from a recent SLR comprising over 8,000 candidate papers, benchmarking both open and commercial state-of-the-art LLMs from mid-2024 and fall 2025. Results demonstrate that our pipeline significantly reduces manual effort while achieving lower error rates than single human annotators. Furthermore, modern open-source models prove sufficient for this task, making the method accessible and cost-effective. Overall, our work demonstrates how responsible human-AI collaboration can accelerate and enhance systematic literature reviews within academic workflows.
2510.12474v1	SMEC: Rethinking Matryoshka Representation Learning for Retrieval Embedding Compression . Large language models (LLMs) generate high-dimensional embeddings that capture rich semantic and syntactic information. However, high-dimensional embeddings exacerbate computational complexity and storage requirements, thereby hindering practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel training framework named Sequential Matryoshka Embedding Compression (SMEC). This framework introduces the Sequential Matryoshka Representation Learning(SMRL) method to mitigate gradient variance during training, the Adaptive Dimension Selection (ADS) module to reduce information degradation during dimension pruning, and the Selectable Cross-batch Memory (S-XBM) module to enhance unsupervised learning between high- and low-dimensional embeddings. Experiments on image, text, and multimodal datasets demonstrate that SMEC achieves significant dimensionality reduction while maintaining performance. For instance, on the BEIR dataset, our approach improves the performance of compressed LLM2Vec embeddings (256 dimensions) by 1.1 points and 2.7 points compared to the Matryoshka-Adaptor and Search-Adaptor models, respectively.
2510.12640v1	On Foundation Models for Temporal Point Processes to Accelerate Scientific Discovery . Many scientific fields, from medicine to seismology, rely on analyzing sequences of events over time to understand complex systems. Traditionally, machine learning models must be built and trained from scratch for each new dataset, which is a slow and costly process. We introduce a new approach: a single, powerful model that learns the underlying patterns of event data in context. We trained this "foundation model" on millions of simulated event sequences, teaching it a general-purpose understanding of how events can unfold. As a result, our model can analyze new scientific data instantly, without retraining, simply by looking at a few examples from the dataset. It can also be quickly fine-tuned for even higher accuracy. This approach makes sophisticated event analysis more accessible and accelerates the pace of scientific discovery.
2510.12721v1	CARVQ: Corrective Adaptor with Group Residual Vector Quantization for LLM Embedding Compression . Large Language Models (LLMs) typically rely on a large number of parameters for token embedding, leading to substantial storage requirements and memory footprints. In particular, LLMs deployed on edge devices are memory-bound, and reducing the memory footprint by compressing the embedding layer not only frees up the memory bandwidth but also speeds up inference. To address this, we introduce CARVQ, a post-training novel Corrective Adaptor combined with group Residual Vector Quantization. CARVQ relies on the composition of both linear and non-linear maps and mimics the original model embedding to compress to approximately 1.6 bits without requiring specialized hardware to support lower-bit storage. We test our method on pre-trained LLMs such as LLaMA-3.2-1B, LLaMA-3.2-3B, LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct, LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B and Phi-4, evaluating on common generative, discriminative, math and reasoning tasks. We show that in most cases, CARVQ can achieve lower average bitwidth-per-parameter while maintaining reasonable perplexity and accuracy compared to scalar quantization. Our contributions include a novel compression technique that is compatible with state-of-the-art transformer quantization methods and can be seamlessly integrated into any hardware supporting 4-bit memory to reduce the model's memory footprint in memory-constrained devices. This work demonstrates a crucial step toward the efficient deployment of LLMs on edge devices.
2510.12793v1	ViCO: A Training Strategy towards Semantic Aware Dynamic High-Resolution . Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from increased inference costs due to the additional vision tokens introduced by image inputs. In this work, we propose Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO), a novel training algorithm that enables the model to represent images of varying semantic complexities using different numbers of vision tokens. The key idea behind our method is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image compression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic complexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between the responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we introduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that automatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch. Compared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the number of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically adapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning, and OCR capabilities. We hope this work will contribute to the development of more efficient MLLMs. The code and models will be released to facilitate future research.
2510.13151v1	Foveation Improves Payload Capacity in Steganography . Steganography finds its use in visual medium such as providing metadata and watermarking. With support of efficient latent representations and foveated rendering, we trained models that improve existing capacity limits from 100 to 500 bits, while achieving better accuracy of up to 1 failure bit out of 2000, at 200K test bits. Finally, we achieve a comparable visual quality of 31.47 dB PSNR and 0.13 LPIPS, showing the effectiveness of novel perceptual design in creating multi-modal latent representations in steganography.
2510.13217v1	LLM-guided Hierarchical Retrieval . Modern IR systems are increasingly tasked with answering complex, multi-faceted queries that require deep reasoning rather than simple keyword or semantic matching. While LLM-based IR has shown great promise, the prevailing retrieve-then-rerank paradigm inherits the limitations of embedding-based retrieval; parametric generative approaches are difficult to update with new information; and long-context methods that place the entire corpus in context are computationally infeasible for large document collections. To address these challenges, we introduce LATTICE, a hierarchical retrieval framework that enables an LLM to reason over and navigate large corpora with logarithmic search complexity by imposing a semantic tree structure on the corpus. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) an offline phase that organizes the corpus into a semantic hierarchy via either a bottom-up agglomerative strategy or a top-down divisive strategy using multi-level summaries and (2) an online traversal phase where a search LLM navigates this tree. A central challenge in such LLM-guided search is that the model's relevance judgments are noisy, context-dependent, and unaware of the hierarchy, making cross-branch and cross-level comparisons difficult. To overcome this, we propose a traversal algorithm that estimates calibrated latent relevance scores from local LLM outputs and aggregates them into a global path relevance metric. Our training-free framework achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, demonstrating up to 9% improvement in Recall@100 and 5% in nDCG@10 over the next best zero-shot baseline. Furthermore, compared to the fine-tuned SOTA method DIVER-v2, LATTICE attains comparable results on BRIGHT subsets that use a static corpus for evaluation.
2510.13316v1	Visual Interestingness Decoded: How GPT-4o Mirrors Human Interests . Our daily life is highly influenced by what we consume and see. Attracting and holding one's attention -- the definition of (visual) interestingness -- is essential. The rise of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) trained on large-scale visual and textual data has demonstrated impressive capabilities. We explore these models' potential to understand to what extent the concepts of visual interestingness are captured and examine the alignment between human assessments and GPT-4o's, a leading LMM, predictions through comparative analysis. Our studies reveal partial alignment between humans and GPT-4o. It already captures the concept as best compared to state-of-the-art methods. Hence, this allows for the effective labeling of image pairs according to their (commonly) interestingness, which are used as training data to distill the knowledge into a learning-to-rank model. The insights pave the way for a deeper understanding of human interest.
2510.13329v1	Embedding-Based Context-Aware Reranker . Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely on retrieving relevant evidence from a corpus to support downstream generation. The common practice of splitting a long document into multiple shorter passages enables finer-grained and targeted information retrieval. However, it also introduces challenges when a correct retrieval would require inference across passages, such as resolving coreference, disambiguating entities, and aggregating evidence scattered across multiple sources. Many state-of-the-art (SOTA) reranking methods, despite utilizing powerful large pretrained language models with potentially high inference costs, still neglect the aforementioned challenges. Therefore, we propose Embedding-Based Context-Aware Reranker (EBCAR), a lightweight reranking framework operating directly on embeddings of retrieved passages with enhanced cross-passage understandings through the structural information of the passages and a hybrid attention mechanism, which captures both high-level interactions across documents and low-level relationships within each document. We evaluate EBCAR against SOTA rerankers on the ConTEB benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness for information retrieval requiring cross-passage inference and its advantages in both accuracy and efficiency.
2510.13454v1	VIST3A: Text-to-3D by Stitching a Multi-view Reconstruction Network to a Video Generator . The rapid progress of large, pretrained models for both visual content generation and 3D reconstruction opens up new possibilities for text-to-3D generation. Intuitively, one could obtain a formidable 3D scene generator if one were able to combine the power of a modern latent text-to-video model as "generator" with the geometric abilities of a recent (feedforward) 3D reconstruction system as "decoder". We introduce VIST3A, a general framework that does just that, addressing two main challenges. First, the two components must be joined in a way that preserves the rich knowledge encoded in their weights. We revisit model stitching, i.e., we identify the layer in the 3D decoder that best matches the latent representation produced by the text-to-video generator and stitch the two parts together. That operation requires only a small dataset and no labels. Second, the text-to-video generator must be aligned with the stitched 3D decoder, to ensure that the generated latents are decodable into consistent, perceptually convincing 3D scene geometry. To that end, we adapt direct reward finetuning, a popular technique for human preference alignment. We evaluate the proposed VIST3A approach with different video generators and 3D reconstruction models. All tested pairings markedly improve over prior text-to-3D models that output Gaussian splats. Moreover, by choosing a suitable 3D base model, VIST3A also enables high-quality text-to-pointmap generation.
2510.13756v1	RECODE: Reasoning Through Code Generation for Visual Question Answering . Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with precise reasoning for structured visuals like charts and diagrams, as pixel-based perception lacks a mechanism for verification. To address this, we propose to leverage derendering -- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new modality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an agentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce the input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful reconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only transforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem, but also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On various visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K, RECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use code for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning.
2510.13922v1	LTR-ICD: A Learning-to-Rank Approach for Automatic ICD Coding . Clinical notes contain unstructured text provided by clinicians during patient encounters. These notes are usually accompanied by a sequence of diagnostic codes following the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Correctly assigning and ordering ICD codes are essential for medical diagnosis and reimbursement. However, automating this task remains challenging. State-of-the-art methods treated this problem as a classification task, leading to ignoring the order of ICD codes that is essential for different purposes. In this work, as a first attempt, we approach this task from a retrieval system perspective to consider the order of codes, thus formulating this problem as a classification and ranking task. Our results and analysis show that the proposed framework has a superior ability to identify high-priority codes compared to other methods. For instance, our model accuracy in correctly ranking primary diagnosis codes is 47%, compared to 20% for the state-of-the-art classifier. Additionally, in terms of classification metrics, the proposed model achieves a micro- and macro-F1 scores of 0.6065 and 0.2904, respectively, surpassing the previous best model with scores of 0.597 and 0.2660.
2510.13979v1	Do Slides Help? Multi-modal Context for Automatic Transcription of Conference Talks . State-of-the-art (SOTA) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems primarily rely on acoustic information while disregarding additional multi-modal context. However, visual information are essential in disambiguation and adaptation. While most work focus on speaker images to handle noise conditions, this work also focuses on integrating presentation slides for the use cases of scientific presentation.   In a first step, we create a benchmark for multi-modal presentation including an automatic analysis of transcribing domain-specific terminology. Next, we explore methods for augmenting speech models with multi-modal information. We mitigate the lack of datasets with accompanying slides by a suitable approach of data augmentation. Finally, we train a model using the augmented dataset, resulting in a relative reduction in word error rate of approximately 34%, across all words and 35%, for domain-specific terms compared to the baseline model.
2510.14240v1	LiveResearchBench: A Live Benchmark for User-Centric Deep Research in the Wild . Deep research -- producing comprehensive, citation-grounded reports by searching and synthesizing information from hundreds of live web sources -- marks an important frontier for agentic systems. To rigorously evaluate this ability, four principles are essential: tasks should be (1) user-centric, reflecting realistic information needs, (2) dynamic, requiring up-to-date information beyond parametric knowledge, (3) unambiguous, ensuring consistent interpretation across users, and (4) multi-faceted and search-intensive, requiring search over numerous web sources and in-depth analysis. Existing benchmarks fall short of these principles, often focusing on narrow domains or posing ambiguous questions that hinder fair comparison. Guided by these principles, we introduce LiveResearchBench, a benchmark of 100 expert-curated tasks spanning daily life, enterprise, and academia, each requiring extensive, dynamic, real-time web search and synthesis. Built with over 1,500 hours of human labor, LiveResearchBench provides a rigorous basis for systematic evaluation. To evaluate citation-grounded long-form reports, we introduce DeepEval, a comprehensive suite covering both content- and report-level quality, including coverage, presentation, citation accuracy and association, consistency and depth of analysis. DeepEval integrates four complementary evaluation protocols, each designed to ensure stable assessment and high agreement with human judgments. Using LiveResearchBench and DeepEval, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier deep research systems, including single-agent web search, single-agent deep research, and multi-agent systems. Our analysis reveals current strengths, recurring failure modes, and key system components needed to advance reliable, insightful deep research.
2510.14327v1	What is missing from this picture? Persistent homology and mixup barcodes as a means of investigating negative embedding space . Recent work in the information sciences, especially informetrics and scientometrics, has made substantial contributions to the development of new metrics that eschew the intrinsic biases of citation metrics. This work has tended to employ either network scientific (topological) approaches to quantifying the disruptiveness of peer-reviewed research, or topic modeling approaches to quantifying conceptual novelty. We propose a combination of these approaches, investigating the prospect of topological data analysis (TDA), specifically persistent homology and mixup barcodes, as a means of understanding the negative space among document embeddings generated by topic models. Using top2vec, we embed documents and topics in n-dimensional space, we use persistent homology to identify holes in the embedding distribution, and then use mixup barcodes to determine which holes are being filled by a set of unobserved publications. In this case, the unobserved publications represent research that was published before or after the data used to train top2vec. We investigate the extent that negative embedding space represents missing context (older research) versus innovation space (newer research), and the extend that the documents that occupy this space represents integrations of the research topics on the periphery. Potential applications for this metric are discussed.
2510.14536v1	Exploring Image Representation with Decoupled Classical Visual Descriptors . Exploring and understanding efficient image representations is a long-standing challenge in computer vision. While deep learning has achieved remarkable progress across image understanding tasks, its internal representations are often opaque, making it difficult to interpret how visual information is processed. In contrast, classical visual descriptors (e.g. edge, colour, and intensity distribution) have long been fundamental to image analysis and remain intuitively understandable to humans. Motivated by this gap, we ask a central question: Can modern learning benefit from these classical cues? In this paper, we answer it with VisualSplit, a framework that explicitly decomposes images into decoupled classical descriptors, treating each as an independent but complementary component of visual knowledge. Through a reconstruction-driven pre-training scheme, VisualSplit learns to capture the essence of each visual descriptor while preserving their interpretability. By explicitly decomposing visual attributes, our method inherently facilitates effective attribute control in various advanced visual tasks, including image generation and editing, extending beyond conventional classification and segmentation, suggesting the effectiveness of this new learning approach for visual understanding.

2510.14862v1	Multi-modal video data-pipelines for machine learning with minimal human supervision . The real-world is inherently multi-modal at its core. Our tools observe and take snapshots of it, in digital form, such as videos or sounds, however much of it is lost. Similarly for actions and information passing between humans, languages are used as a written form of communication. Traditionally, Machine Learning models have been unimodal (i.e. rgb -> semantic or text -> sentiment_class). Recent trends go towards bi-modality, where images and text are learned together, however, in order to truly understand the world, we need to integrate all these independent modalities. In this work we try to combine as many visual modalities as we can using little to no human supervision. In order to do this, we use pre-trained experts and procedural combinations between them on top of raw videos using a fully autonomous data-pipeline, which we also open-source. We then make use of PHG-MAE, a model specifically designed to leverage multi-modal data. We show that this model which was efficiently distilled into a low-parameter (<1M) can have competitive results compared to models of ~300M parameters. We deploy this model and analyze the use-case of real-time semantic segmentation from handheld devices or webcams on commodity hardware. Finally, we deploy other off-the-shelf models using the same framework, such as DPT for near real-time depth estimation.
2510.16598v1	VisionSelector: End-to-End Learnable Visual Token Compression for Efficient Multimodal LLMs . Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter significant computational and memory bottlenecks from the massive number of visual tokens generated by high-resolution images or multi-image inputs. Previous token compression techniques are often constrained by heuristic rules that risk discarding critical information. They may suffer from biases, such as attention sinks, that lead to sharp performance drops under aggressive compression ratios. To address these limitations, we reformulate token compression as a lightweight plug-and-play framework that reformulates token compression into an end-to-end learnable decision process. To be specific, we propose VisionSelector, a scorer module decoupled from the MLLM backbone that incorporates a differentiable Top-K mechanism and a curriculum annealing strategy to bridge the training-inference gap, enabling efficient and adaptive token selection various arbitrary compression rates. Remarkably lightweight with only 12.85M trainable parameters, VisionSelector demonstrates generalization across various compression rates and adaptively identifying critical tokens. This leads to superior performance across all compression budgets, evidenced by preserving 100% accuracy on MME with 30% retention budget, outperforming prior methods by 12.14% at 10% retention budget, and doubling prefill speed. Our code is available at https://github.com/JulietChoo/VisionSelector .
2510.16753v1	ELMM: Efficient Lightweight Multimodal Large Language Models for Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion . Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MKGs) extend traditional knowledge graphs by incorporating visual and textual modalities, enabling richer and more expressive entity representations. However, existing MKGs often suffer from incompleteness, which hinder their effectiveness in downstream tasks. Therefore, multimodal knowledge graph completion (MKGC) task is receiving increasing attention. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for knowledge graph completion (KGC), their application to the multimodal setting remains underexplored. Moreover, applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to the task of MKGC introduces significant challenges: (1) the large number of image tokens per entity leads to semantic noise and modality conflicts, and (2) the high computational cost of processing large token inputs. To address these issues, we propose Efficient Lightweight Multimodal Large Language Models (ELMM) for MKGC. ELMM proposes a Multi-view Visual Token Compressor (MVTC) based on multi-head attention mechanism, which adaptively compresses image tokens from both textual and visual views, thereby effectively reducing redundancy while retaining necessary information and avoiding modality conflicts. Additionally, we design an attention pruning strategy to remove redundant attention layers from MLLMs, thereby significantly reducing the inference cost. We further introduce a linear projection to compensate for the performance degradation caused by pruning. Extensive experiments on benchmark FB15k-237-IMG and WN18-IMG demonstrate that ELMM achieves state-of-the-art performance while substantially improving computational efficiency, establishing a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge graph completion.
2510.16769v1	See or Say Graphs: Agent-Driven Scalable Graph Understanding with Vision-Language Models . Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in graph understanding, but remain limited by input-token constraints, facing scalability bottlenecks and lacking effective mechanisms to coordinate textual and visual modalities. To address these challenges, we propose GraphVista, a unified framework that enhances both scalability and modality coordination in graph understanding. For scalability, GraphVista organizes graph information hierarchically into a lightweight GraphRAG base, which retrieves only task-relevant textual descriptions and high-resolution visual subgraphs, compressing redundant context while preserving key reasoning elements. For modality coordination, GraphVista introduces a planning agent that routes tasks to the most suitable modality-using the text modality for simple property reasoning and the visual modality for local and structurally complex reasoning grounded in explicit topology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphVista scales to large graphs, up to $200\times$ larger than those used in existing benchmarks, and consistently outperforms existing textual, visual, and fusion-based methods, achieving up to $4.4\times$ quality improvement over the state-of-the-art baselines by fully exploiting the complementary strengths of both modalities.
2510.17013v1	DiscoTrack: A Multilingual LLM Benchmark for Discourse Tracking . Recent LLM benchmarks have tested models on a range of phenomena, but are still focused primarily on natural language understanding for extraction of explicit information, such as QA or summarization, with responses often tar- geting information from individual sentences. We are still lacking more challenging, and im- portantly also multilingual, benchmarks focus- ing on implicit information and pragmatic infer- ences across larger documents in the context of discourse tracking: integrating and aggregating information across sentences, paragraphs and multiple speaker utterances. To this end, we present DiscoTrack, an LLM benchmark target- ing a range of tasks across 12 languages and four levels of discourse understanding: salience recognition, entity tracking, discourse relations and bridging inference. Our evaluation shows that these tasks remain challenging, even for state-of-the-art models.
2510.17132v1	Do LLMs Recognize Your Latent Preferences? A Benchmark for Latent Information Discovery in Personalized Interaction . Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at producing broadly relevant text, but this generality becomes a limitation when user-specific preferences are required, such as recommending restaurants or planning travel. In these scenarios, users rarely articulate every preference explicitly; instead, much of what they care about remains latent, waiting to be inferred. This raises a fundamental question: Can LLMs uncover and reason about such latent information through conversation?   We address this problem by introducing a unified benchmark for evaluating latent information discovery - the ability of LLMs to reveal and utilize hidden user attributes through multi-turn interaction. The benchmark spans three progressively realistic settings: the classic 20 Questions game, Personalized Question Answering, and Personalized Text Summarization. All tasks share a tri-agent framework (User, Assistant, Judge) enabling turn-level evaluation of elicitation and adaptation. Our results reveal that while LLMs can indeed surface latent information through dialogue, their success varies dramatically with context: from 32% to 98%, depending on task complexity, topic, and number of hidden attributes. This benchmark provides the first systematic framework for studying latent information discovery in personalized interaction, highlighting that effective preference inference remains an open frontier for building truly adaptive AI systems.
2510.17228v1	DSEBench: A Test Collection for Explainable Dataset Search with Examples . Dataset search has been an established information retrieval task. Current paradigms either retrieve datasets that are relevant to a keyword query or find datasets that are similar to an input target dataset. To allow for their combined specification of information needs, in this article, we investigate the more generalized task of Dataset Search with Examples (DSE) and further extend it to Explainable DSE that requires identifying the metadata and content fields of a dataset that indicate its relevance to the query and similarity to the target datasets. To facilitate this research, we construct DSEBench, a test collection that provides high-quality dataset- and field-level annotations to enable the evaluation of explainable DSE. We also employ a large language model to generate numerous annotations to be used for training. We establish extensive baselines on DSEBench by adapting and evaluating a variety of sparse, dense, and LLM-based retrieval, reranking, and explanation methods.
2510.17800v2	Glyph: Scaling Context Windows via Visual-Text Compression . Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on long-context modeling for tasks such as document understanding, code analysis, and multi-step reasoning. However, scaling context windows to the million-token level brings prohibitive computational and memory costs, limiting the practicality of long-context LLMs. In this work, we take a different perspective-visual context scaling-to tackle this challenge. Instead of extending token-based sequences, we propose Glyph, a framework that renders long texts into images and processes them with vision-language models (VLMs). This approach substantially compresses textual input while preserving semantic information, and we further design an LLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations for balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining accuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context benchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and decoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme compression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text tasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodal tasks, such as document understanding. Our code and model are released at https://github.com/thu-coai/Glyph.
2510.18234v1	DeepSeek-OCR: Contexts Optical Compression . We present DeepSeek-OCR as an initial investigation into the feasibility of compressing long contexts via optical 2D mapping. DeepSeek-OCR consists of two components: DeepEncoder and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as the decoder. Specifically, DeepEncoder serves as the core engine, designed to maintain low activations under high-resolution input while achieving high compression ratios to ensure an optimal and manageable number of vision tokens. Experiments show that when the number of text tokens is within 10 times that of vision tokens (i.e., a compression ratio < 10x), the model can achieve decoding (OCR) precision of 97%. Even at a compression ratio of 20x, the OCR accuracy still remains at about 60%. This shows considerable promise for research areas such as historical long-context compression and memory forgetting mechanisms in LLMs. Beyond this, DeepSeek-OCR also demonstrates high practical value. On OmniDocBench, it surpasses GOT-OCR2.0 (256 tokens/page) using only 100 vision tokens, and outperforms MinerU2.0 (6000+ tokens per page on average) while utilizing fewer than 800 vision tokens. In production, DeepSeek-OCR can generate training data for LLMs/VLMs at a scale of 200k+ pages per day (a single A100-40G). Codes and model weights are publicly accessible at http://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-OCR.
2510.18269v1	StreamingTOM: Streaming Token Compression for Efficient Video Understanding . Unlike offline processing, streaming video vision-language models face two fundamental constraints: causality and accumulation. Causality prevents access to future frames that offline methods exploit, while accumulation causes tokens to grow unbounded, creating efficiency bottlenecks. However, existing approaches only regulate post-LLM kv-cache, leaving costly pre-LLM prefill unchanged. We introduce StreamingTOM, a training-free, plug-and-play two-stage framework that addresses both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks with predictable latency. Causal Temporal Reduction imposes a fixed per-frame budget and selects tokens based on adjacent-frame changes and token saliency, drastically reducing per-frame prefill cost by processing only a compact subset of visual tokens per frame instead of all visual tokens. Online Quantized Memory stores tokens in 4-bit format, retrieves relevant groups on demand, and dequantizes them, keeping the active kv-cache bounded regardless of stream length. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves $15.7\times$ kv-cache compression, $1.2\times$ lower peak memory and $2\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA. StreamingTOM maintains state-of-the-art accuracy among training-free methods with an average of $63.8\%$ on offline benchmarks and $55.8\%/3.7$ on RVS. These results highlight the practical benefits of our two-stage approach for efficient streaming video understanding with bounded growth.
2510.18279v2	Text or Pixels? It Takes Half: On the Token Efficiency of Visual Text Inputs in Multimodal LLMs . Large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants can now process visual inputs, including images of text. This raises an intriguing question: can we compress textual inputs by feeding them as images to reduce token usage while preserving performance? In this paper, we show that visual text representations are a practical and surprisingly effective form of input compression for decoder LLMs. We exploit the idea of rendering long text inputs as a single image and provide it directly to the model. This leads to dramatically reduced number of decoder tokens required, offering a new form of input compression. Through experiments on two distinct benchmarks RULER (long-context retrieval) and CNN/DailyMail (document summarization) we demonstrate that this text-as-image method yields substantial token savings (often nearly half) without degrading task performance.
2510.18527v2	LLMs as Sparse Retrievers:A Framework for First-Stage Product Search . Product search is a crucial component of modern e-commerce platforms, with billions of user queries every day. In product search systems, first-stage retrieval should achieve high recall while ensuring efficient online deployment. Sparse retrieval is particularly attractive in this context due to its interpretability and storage efficiency. However, sparse retrieval methods suffer from severe vocabulary mismatch issues, leading to suboptimal performance in product search scenarios. With their potential for semantic analysis, large language models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for mitigating vocabulary mismatch issues and thereby improving retrieval quality. Directly applying LLMs to sparse retrieval in product search exposes two key challenges:(1)Queries and product titles are typically short and highly susceptible to LLM-induced hallucinations, such as generating irrelevant expansion terms or underweighting critical literal terms like brand names and model numbers;(2)The large vocabulary space of LLMs leads to difficulty in initializing training effectively, making it challenging to learn meaningful sparse representations in such ultra-high-dimensional spaces.To address these challenges, we propose PROSPER, a framework for PROduct search leveraging LLMs as SParsE Retrievers. PROSPER incorporates: (1)A literal residual network that alleviates hallucination in lexical expansion by reinforcing underweighted literal terms through a residual compensation mechanism; and (2)A lexical focusing window that facilitates effective training initialization via a coarse-to-fine sparsification strategy.Extensive offline and online experiments show that PROSPER significantly outperforms sparse baselines and achieves recall performance comparable to advanced dense retrievers, while also achieving revenue increments online.
2510.18659v1	Sherlock Your Queries: Learning to Ask the Right Questions for Dialogue-Based Retrieval . User queries in information retrieval are often ambiguous, making it challenging for systems to identify a user's target from a single query. While recent dialogue-based interactive retrieval systems can clarify user intent, they are inefficient as they often lack an explicit strategy to ask the most informative questions. To address this limitation, we propose SherlockLLM, a dialogue-driven retrieval framework that learns an optimal questioning strategy via Reinforcement Learning (RL) and avoids the need for large-scale annotated dialogue data. In our framework, an agent is trained to generate a sequence of binary questions to efficiently narrow down the search space. To validate our approach, we introduce a benchmark with both structured and unstructured tasks. Experimental results show that SherlockLLM is a robust and efficient solution. On the structured tasks, its performance matches strong baselines and approaches the theoretical optimal defined by binary search. On the challenging unstructured task, our agent significantly outperforms these baselines, showcasing its ability to learn a highly effective information-seeking dialogue policy.
2510.18703v1	Exploring a Unified Vision-Centric Contrastive Alternatives on Multi-Modal Web Documents . Contrastive vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks by learning from aligned image-text pairs. However, their ability to handle complex, real-world web documents remains limited, particularly in scenarios where text and images are interleaved, loosely aligned, or embedded in visual form. To address these challenges, we propose Vision-Centric Contrastive Learning (VC2L), a unified framework that models text, images, and their combinations using a single vision transformer. VC2L operates entirely in pixel space by rendering all inputs, whether textual, visual, or combined, as images, thus eliminating the need for OCR, text tokenization, or modality fusion strategy. To capture complex cross-modal relationships in multimodal web documents, VC2L employs a snippet-level contrastive learning objective that aligns consecutive multimodal segments, leveraging the inherent coherence of documents without requiring explicitly paired image-text data. To assess the effectiveness of this approach, we introduce three retrieval benchmarks, AnyCIR, SeqCIR, and CSR, designed to evaluate cross-modal retrieval, fine-grained sequential understanding, and generalization to unseen data, respectively. Empirical results show that VC2L achieves competitive or superior performance compared to CLIP-style models on both the proposed benchmarks and established datasets such as M-BEIR and MTEB. These findings underscore the potential of multimodal web data as a valuable training resource for contrastive learning and illustrate the scalability of a unified, vision-centric approach for multimodal representation learning. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/showlab/VC2L.
2510.18840v1	See the Text: From Tokenization to Visual Reading . People see text. Humans read by recognizing words as visual objects, including their shapes, layouts, and patterns, before connecting them to meaning, which enables us to handle typos, distorted fonts, and various scripts effectively. Modern large language models (LLMs), however, rely on subword tokenization, fragmenting text into pieces from a fixed vocabulary. While effective for high-resource languages, this approach over-segments low-resource languages, yielding long, linguistically meaningless sequences and inflating computation. In this work, we challenge this entrenched paradigm and move toward a vision-centric alternative. Our method, SeeTok, renders text as images (visual-text) and leverages pretrained multimodal LLMs to interpret them, reusing strong OCR and text-vision alignment abilities learned from large-scale multimodal training. Across three different language tasks, SeeTok matches or surpasses subword tokenizers while requiring 4.43 times fewer tokens and reducing FLOPs by 70.5%, with additional gains in cross-lingual generalization, robustness to typographic noise, and linguistic hierarchy. SeeTok signals a shift from symbolic tokenization to human-like visual reading, and takes a step toward more natural and cognitively inspired language models.
2510.18939v1	Lost in the Maze: Overcoming Context Limitations in Long-Horizon Agentic Search . Long-horizon agentic search requires iteratively exploring the web over long trajectories and synthesizing information across many sources, and is the foundation for enabling powerful applications like deep research systems. In this work, we show that popular agentic search frameworks struggle to scale to long trajectories primarily due to context limitations-they accumulate long, noisy content, hit context window and tool budgets, or stop early. Then, we introduce SLIM (Simple Lightweight Information Management), a simple framework that separates retrieval into distinct search and browse tools, and periodically summarizes the trajectory, keeping context concise while enabling longer, more focused searches. On long-horizon tasks, SLIM achieves comparable performance at substantially lower cost and with far fewer tool calls than strong open-source baselines across multiple base models. Specifically, with o3 as the base model, SLIM achieves 56% on BrowseComp and 31% on HLE, outperforming all open-source frameworks by 8 and 4 absolute points, respectively, while incurring 4-6x fewer tool calls. Finally, we release an automated fine-grained trajectory analysis pipeline and error taxonomy for characterizing long-horizon agentic search frameworks; SLIM exhibits fewer hallucinations than prior systems. We hope our analysis framework and simple tool design inform future long-horizon agents.
2510.20362v1	ComProScanner: A multi-agent based framework for composition-property structured data extraction from scientific literature . Since the advent of various pre-trained large language models, extracting structured knowledge from scientific text has experienced a revolutionary change compared with traditional machine learning or natural language processing techniques. Despite these advances, accessible automated tools that allow users to construct, validate, and visualise datasets from scientific literature extraction remain scarce. We therefore developed ComProScanner, an autonomous multi-agent platform that facilitates the extraction, validation, classification, and visualisation of machine-readable chemical compositions and properties, integrated with synthesis data from journal articles for comprehensive database creation. We evaluated our framework using 100 journal articles against 10 different LLMs, including both open-source and proprietary models, to extract highly complex compositions associated with ceramic piezoelectric materials and corresponding piezoelectric strain coefficients (d33), motivated by the lack of a large dataset for such materials. DeepSeek-V3-0324 outperformed all models with a significant overall accuracy of 0.82. This framework provides a simple, user-friendly, readily-usable package for extracting highly complex experimental data buried in the literature to build machine learning or deep learning datasets.
2510.20707v1	Mixing Importance with Diversity: Joint Optimization for KV Cache Compression in Large Vision-Language Models . Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this, we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV} consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency. Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable performance gains. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/xuyang-liu16/MixKV}{\textcolor{citeblue}{https://github.com/xuyang-liu16/MixKV}}.
2510.20797v1	Simple Context Compression: Mean-Pooling and Multi-Ratio Training . A common strategy to reduce the computational costs of using long contexts in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is soft context compression, where the input sequence is transformed into a shorter continuous representation. We develop a lightweight and simple mean-pooling approach that consistently outperforms the widely used compression-tokens architecture, and study training the same compressor to output multiple compression ratios. We conduct extensive experiments across in-domain and out-of-domain QA datasets, as well as across model families, scales, and compression ratios. Overall, our simple mean-pooling approach achieves the strongest performance, with a relatively small drop when training for multiple compression ratios. More broadly though, across architectures and training regimes the trade-offs are more nuanced, illustrating the complex landscape of compression methods.
2510.20801v1	Compression of Voxelized Vector Field Data by Boxes is Hard . Voxelized vector field data consists of a vector field over a high dimensional lattice. The lattice consists of integer coordinates called voxels. The voxelized vector field assigns a vector at each voxel. This data type encompasses images, tensors, and voxel data.   Assume there is a nice energy function on the vector field. We consider the problem of lossy compression of voxelized vector field data in Shannon's rate-distortion framework. This means the data is compressed then decompressed up to a bound on the distortion of the energy at each voxel. We formulate this in terms of compressing a single voxelized vector field by a collection of box summary pairs. We call this problem the $(k,D)$-RectLossyVFCompression} problem.   We show three main results about this problem. The first is that decompression for this problem is polynomial time tractable. This means that the only obstruction to a tractable solution of the $(k,D)$-RectLossyVFCompression problem lies in the compression stage. This is shown by the two hardness results about the compression stage. We show that the compression stage is NP-Hard to compute exactly and that it is even APX-Hard to approximate for $k,D\geq 2$.   Assuming $P\neq NP$, this shows that when $k,D \geq 2$ there can be no exact polynomial time algorithm nor can there even be a PTAS approximation algorithm for the $(k,D)$-RectLossyVFCompression problem.
2510.22670v1	Tools are under-documented: Simple Document Expansion Boosts Tool Retrieval . Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities in tool use, yet progress in tool retrieval remains hindered by incomplete and heterogeneous tool documentation. To address this challenge, we introduce Tool-DE, a new benchmark and framework that systematically enriches tool documentation with structured fields to enable more effective tool retrieval, together with two dedicated models, Tool-Embed and Tool-Rank. We design a scalable document expansion pipeline that leverages both open- and closed-source LLMs to generate, validate, and refine enriched tool profiles at low cost, producing large-scale corpora with 50k instances for embedding-based retrievers and 200k for rerankers. On top of this data, we develop two models specifically tailored for tool retrieval: Tool-Embed, a dense retriever, and Tool-Rank, an LLM-based reranker. Extensive experiments on ToolRet and Tool-DE demonstrate that document expansion substantially improves retrieval performance, with Tool-Embed and Tool-Rank achieving new state-of-the-art results on both benchmarks. We further analyze the contribution of individual fields to retrieval effectiveness, as well as the broader impact of document expansion on both training and evaluation. Overall, our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of LLM-driven document expansion, positioning Tool-DE, along with the proposed Tool-Embed and Tool-Rank, as a foundation for future research in tool retrieval.
2510.22733v1	$\text{E}^2\text{Rank}$: Your Text Embedding can Also be an Effective and Efficient Listwise Reranker . Text embedding models serve as a fundamental component in real-world search applications. By mapping queries and documents into a shared embedding space, they deliver competitive retrieval performance with high efficiency. However, their ranking fidelity remains limited compared to dedicated rerankers, especially recent LLM-based listwise rerankers, which capture fine-grained query-document and document-document interactions. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective unified framework $\text{E}^2\text{Rank}$, means Efficient Embedding-based Ranking (also means Embedding-to-Rank), which extends a single text embedding model to perform both high-quality retrieval and listwise reranking through continued training under a listwise ranking objective, thereby achieving strong effectiveness with remarkable efficiency. By applying cosine similarity between the query and document embeddings as a unified ranking function, the listwise ranking prompt, which is constructed from the original query and its candidate documents, serves as an enhanced query enriched with signals from the top-K documents, akin to pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) in traditional retrieval models. This design preserves the efficiency and representational quality of the base embedding model while significantly improving its reranking performance. Empirically, $\textrm{E}^2\text{Rank}$ achieves state-of-the-art results on the BEIR reranking benchmark and demonstrates competitive performance on the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, with very low reranking latency. We also show that the ranking training process improves embedding performance on the MTEB benchmark. Our findings indicate that a single embedding model can effectively unify retrieval and reranking, offering both computational efficiency and competitive ranking accuracy.
